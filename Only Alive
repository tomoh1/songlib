  <lyrics>[Intro]
. Bb F Bb F

[V1]
.       Bb                         F
 I'm a fair-weather friend, I'm a colorless view
.         Bb                F
 But I'm willin' to make a deal
.         Bb                     F
 If you think you can make some faith here inside
.       Bb                 F
 I'll drive off and marry you

[C1]
.          Dm    Bb   F
 I'm only alive with You
.            Dm       Bm          Asus
 I can't get by and I won't get through
.                  Dm       Bb           F
 So put me in the river and let me say "I do"
.          Dm    Bb   F
 I'm only alive with You

[V2]
 You're a sight for sore eyes and a newborn cry
 In a year where there are so few
 If you throw me a line, I'll show you in time
 I'm falling in love with you
---



[V3]
 Though my heart has been torn by loves I have worn
 And I'm tempted by them ever still
 I tremble inside when you walk in the room
 You hold my affections and will 

[C2]
 We're only alive with You
 We can't get by and we won't get through
 So put us in the river and let us say "I do"
 We're only alive with You
