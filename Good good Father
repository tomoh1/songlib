[V1]
.    A             Asus
 Oh, I've heard a thousand stories
.    A         Asus
 Of what they think You're like
.    A               Asus
 But I've heard the tender whisper
.    A          Asus
 Of love in the dead of night
.     D       A/C#
 You tell me that You're pleased
.         Bm          E  Esus
 And that I'm never alone

[C]
.                     D
 You're a Good, Good Father
.                 A/C#
 It's who You are, It's who You are,
.Bm              E
 It's who You are
.                  D
 and I'm loved by You
.               A/C#
 It's who I am, It's who I am,
.Bm           E
 It's who I am

 For answers only You provide
