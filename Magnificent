  <lyrics>[v1]
 Who compares to You
 Who set the stars in their place
 You who calmed the raging seas
 That came crashing over me
[v2]
 Who compares to You
 You who bring the morning light
 The hope of all the earth
 Is rest assured in Your great love
[c]
 You are magnificent
 Eternally wonderful, glorious
 Jesus, no one ever will compare
 To You, Jesus
[v3]
 Where the evening fades, 
 You call forth songs of joy,
 As the morning wakes,
 We Your children give You praise</lyrics></song>
