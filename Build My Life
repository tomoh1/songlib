  <title>Build My Life</title>
  <lyrics>[v1]
 Worthy of every song 
 we could ever sing
 Worthy of all the praise 
 we could ever bring |||
 Worthy of every breath 
 we could ever breathe
 We live for You

[v2]
 Jesus, the Name 
 above every other name
 Jesus, the only One 
 who could ever save |||
 Worthy of every breath 
 we could ever breathe
 We live for You
 Oh, we live for You

[c]
 Holy, there is no one like You
 There is none beside You
 Open up my eyes in wonder |||
 And show me who You are
 And fill me with Your heart
 And lead me in Your love 
 to those around me

[b]
 I will build my life
 upon Your love
 It is a firm foundation |||
 I will put my trust
 in You alone
 And I will not be shaken</lyrics>
