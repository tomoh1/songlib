  <lyrics>[v1]
 I've been running, trying to be one who sees
 I've been working, this salvation out on my knees
 There is nothing better than knowing
 We are redeemed ||
 I'm believing, trusting in creative hands,
 I am praying for our world to bow to your plan
 And this one thought is unmistakable
 To take up my cross and follow You Lord

[c]
 When You stand, the tall trees and mountains bow
 When You speak, the fiercest of oceans is still
 And I see the sinner seek devotion
 The lost become chosen, and I fall to my knees

[v2]
 I'm forgiven by a Savior who did not deserve death
 He was blameless and I was lost in shamefulness
 Undelivered, but it doesn't seem right
 Unless I keep my eyes focused on the Savior who gave His life ||
 In the middle of a world that denies it believes
 It is breaking apart at the very seams
 There is one thing to be alive for
 And it's to take up my cross and follow You Lord

[b]
 I will take up my cross and follow Lord where You lead me
 And I will take up my cross and follow wherever you go </lyrics></song>
