  <lyrics>[v1]
 We will worship the Lamb of Glory
 We will worship the King of Kings
 We will worship the Lamb of Glory
 We will worship the King

[c]
 And with our hands lifted high
 We will worship and sing
 With our hands lifted high
 We come before You rejoicing ||
 With our hands lifted high to the sky
 Ans the world wonders why
 We'll just tell them we're loving our King
 Who-oo-who-oo-who
 We'll just tell them we're loving our King

[v2]
 We bless the name of the Lamb of Glory
 We bless the name of the King of Kings
 We bless the name of the Lamb of Glory
 We bless the name of the King of Kings</lyrics></song>
