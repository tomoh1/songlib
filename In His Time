.Am     Dm7 G7        C
 In His time, in His time,
.         Dm7               G7         C  C7
 He makes all things beautiful, in His time,
.              F           G7
 Lord, please show me everyday,
.          Em               Am
 As You're teaching me Your way,
.         Dm7              G7            C
 That You do just what You say, in Your time.

[V2]
 In Your time, in Your time,
 You make all things beautiful, in Your time.
 Lord, my life to Your I bring,
 May each song I have to sing,
 Be to You a lovely thing, in Your time.
