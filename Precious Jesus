.G    D     C
 I remember You
.         G      D    Em      C
 Precious Jesus, I rememeber You
.       D      C
 Healer of my heart
.       D      C
 Lover of my soul

[c]
.G      D       C
 On You sacred head
.           G              D       Em     C
 A crown of thorns pressed on Your sacred head
.       G                     D
 Mighty king of the universe, merciful lamb
.       C
 For my sin You suffered and bled
.      G                          D
 Still Father, forgive them, they don't understand
.      C
 Sweet Savior, I heard what You said

[b]
.G      D      C
 Jesus, Jesus, we remember
.G      D      C          Em
 Jesus, Jesus, we remember
.       C                    G               D
 As we drink from the cup of salvation, Your blood
.     Em
 (We remember Your sacrifice)
.    C                        D            C
 We remember the way that You suffered for us

[c2]
.G     D        C
 Risen from the grave
.          G      D    Em        C
 Christ immortal risen from the grave
.    G                        D
 At Jerusalem's gate how You wept for the lost
.C
 Even as palm branches
.         G                          D
 Then You proved how You loved us on Calvary's cross
.     C
 And rose up on the third day
.    C
 So all who believe might be saved, yes

[outro]
.    G    D      C
 And we remember You

 Precious Jesus we remember You

.G       D        C
 (Jesus, we love You
.         G       D     Em       C
 Previous Jesus, Jesus, we love You) 2x

.       D      C
 Healer of our hearts
.       D      C
 Lover of our souls</lyrics></song>
