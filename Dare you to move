.              B-C#m    B-C#m  C#m-B-A
 Welcome to the fallout
.              B-C#m    B-C#m  C#m-B-A
 Welcome to resistance
.                F#m
 The tension is here
.              E/G#-A
 The tension is here
.                B-C#m             B-C#m  C#m-B-A
 Between who you are and who you could be
.               F#m                    F#m-E/G#-A
 Between how it is and how it could be

 Dare you to move
.             B
 Dare you to move
.             A     
 Dare you to lift yourself off of the floor

.             E
 Dare you to move
.             B
 Dare you to move
.                  A                     B
 Like today never happened, today never happened

.         E                        A
 Maybe redepemtion has stories to tell
.          E                           A
 Maybe forgiveness is right where you fell
.              C#m                    A
 Where do you run to escape from yourself
.                F#m                  B
 Where you gonna go, where you gonna go
.               E
 Salvation is here
