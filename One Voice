  <lyrics>[V1]
 Father we ask of you this day
 Come and heal our land
 Knit our hearts together 
 That Your glory may be seen in us
 Then the world will know that
 Jesus Christ is Lord
[C]
 Let us be one voice
 That glorifies Your Name
 Let us be one voice
 Declaring that You reign
 Let us be one voice in love and harmony
 And we pray O God, grant us unity
[V2]
 Now is the time for you and I 
 To join our hearts in praise
 That the name of Jesus 
 Will be lifted high above the earth
 Then the world will know that
 Jesus Christ is Lord
[B]
 Let us be
[B2]
 Let us be one voice</lyrics></song>
