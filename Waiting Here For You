  <lyrics>[v1]
 If faith can move the mountains
 Let the mountains move
 We come with expectation
 We're waiting here for you
 Waiting here for you

[v2]
 You're the lord of all creation
 And still you know my heart
 The author of salvation
 You've loved me from the start

[c]
 Waiting here for you 
 With our hands
 Lifted high in praise
 It is you we adore
 Singing alleluia

[v3]
 You are everything you promised
 Your faithfulness is true
 And we're desperate for your presence
 All we need is you
 
[b]
 Alleluia, Alleluia</lyrics>
