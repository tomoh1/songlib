  <lyrics>;Intro:
.B  F#7sus  G#m  E

[v1]
.                 B
 To the cross I look,
.             F#sus
 To the cross I cling
.                     G#m
 Of it's suffering I do drink,
.                  E
 Of it's work I do sing ||
.                B
 For on it my Savior,
.                  F#sus
 Both bruised and crushed
.                   G#m
 Showed that God is love
.           E
 And God is just

[c]
.B
 At the cross You beckon me
.G#m
 You draw me gently to my knees, and I am
.F#sus
 Lost for words, so lost in love, I'm
.E                                 B  G#m  F#sus  E
 Sweetly broken, wholly surrendered

[v2]
.                B
 What a priceless gift,
.            F#sus
 Undeserved life
.             G#m
 Have I been given
.                    E
 Through Christ crucified ||
.                          B
 You've called me out of death,
.                       F#sus
 You've called me into life
.                      G#m
 And I was under Your wrath,
.                               E
 Now through the cross I'm reconciled

[b]
.C#                        E
 In awe of the cross I must confess
.C#
 How wondrous Your redeeming love and
.    E                     F#sus
 How great is Your faithfulness</lyrics></song>
