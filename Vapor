.Bm G G G
.Bm G D D

[V1]
.Bm      G
 Oh the vapor of it all
.Bm      G              A
 Itâ€™s a chasing of the wind
.                      Bm    
 The substance of the form
.    G
 So pale and thin
.                 Bm        G
 We will set our hearts on You again

[C]
.D                     Bm
 Holy, You oh God are holy
.                  G
 Trees clap their hands for You
.              A
 Oceans, they dance for You||

.        Bm  G              Bm  G  D
 You are holy, infinite and holy
.                G
 A billion suns rise for You
.                   A
 Clouds paint the skies for You
.                 G
 Mountains stand tall for You
.             A
 Valleys bow down to You
.            Bm
 Everything rising to
.                 A
 Sing all their songs to You
---
[V2]
 Heaven haunts the hearts of men
 We can feel it from within
 The beauty of it all
 The mystery
 The swelling of a voice
 The rising sea

[V3]
 Oh the mystery of it all
 We can never peer within
 Could never find the words
 To understand
 The fullness of God become a man

[Interlude]
. Bm G D A/C# (4x)

[C2]
 Holy, inexpressible and holy
 Kings become fools for You
 Kingdoms to ruins for You||
 Vapor finds ground in You
 Music finds sound in You
 Everything rising, everything rising
.A
 Everything rising...

[Interlude]

[Outro]
 Come like dawn, like waves, like sunlight
 Bring this world to life
 Come like rain, like breath, like springtime
 Bring this world to life
