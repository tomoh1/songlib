  <lyrics>[V1]
.
 You lay aside Your throne
.
 And to this world You have come
.
 You offered up Your life
.
 The debt You paid was not Yours

[C]
.
 Your grace abounds to me
.
 Your grace abounds to me
.
 Jesus, in You I find all that I need

[V2]
.
 A gift I could not earn
.
 Your open arms are undeserved
.
 Enabled by Your grace
.
 Now to live is Christ alone

[B]
.
 All powerful
.
 All glorious
.
 There's nothing like the Name of Jesus
.
 All powerful
.
 All glorious
.
 There's nothing like Your Name	</lyrics></song>
