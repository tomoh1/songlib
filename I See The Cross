.E                         A
 I see the cross, and it's all I need to see
.c#m                       A
 I see the cross, and it calls me to believe

[c]
.         E         B
 No other way to be reconciled
.      A
 to receive complete forgiveness
.         E                 B
 No other choice could have set us free
.         A 
 Could've paid the price of justice
.f#m        E/g#m           A                 B
 So I come, as I am, to the place where mercy meets me
.          E
 I see the cross

[v2]
 I see the cross, lifted high for all to see
 I see the cross, it's the love the nations need

[b1]
.f#m E/G#          A     B               f#m        
 You suffered and died, poured out Your life
.    E/G#          A       B        f#m    
 You showed us the way, to truly be great
.    E/G#       A          B
 Yet this just begins the Father's full plan
.    E/G#      A     B
 Now there is a way...

[b2]
.                 E    B           A      
 To share in Your Resurrection, to live forever
.E            B         A  
 Through Your death and life
.                 E    B           A    
 To share in Your resurrection, to live forever
.E            B         A    B
 Through Your death and life</lyrics></song>
