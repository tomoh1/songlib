  <lyrics>[V1]
.G         D            Em
 You laid down Your majesty
.          Bm           C
 Gave up everything for me
.         G
 Suffered at the hands 
.    C             D   G
 Of those You had created

[V2]
 You took all my guilt and shame
 When You died and rose again
 Now alone You reign
 In heaven and earth exalted

[V3]
 I really want to worship You, my Lord
 You have won my heart and I am Yours
 Forever and ever I will love You

[V4]
 Youâ€™re the only one who died for me
 Gave Your life to set me free
 Now I lift my voice to You in adoration
