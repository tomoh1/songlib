  <lyrics>[V1]
.E               A       E
 Man of sorrows, Lamb of God
.A      E       B
 By His own betrayed
.    C#m            A        C#m
 The sin of man and wrath of God
.    A       B    E
 Has been on Jesus laid

[V2]
 Silent as He stood accused
 Beaten, mocked and scorned
 Bowing to the Father's will
 He took a crown of thorns

[C]
.         C#m    A            E B
 Oh, that rugged cross, my salvation
.           C#m         A       B
 Where your love poured out over me 
.       C#m        E        B C#m
 Now my soul cries out hallelujah
.           A     B   E
 Praise and honor unto Thee

[V3]
 Sent of heaven, God's own Son
 To purchase and redeem
 And reconcile the very ones
 Who nailed Him to that tree
---
[B]
.       C#m     A
 Now my debt is paid
.      E       B
 It is paid in full
.       C#m      A
 By the precious blood
.        E     B
 That my Jesus spilled ||
.        C#m      A
 Now the curse of sin
.       E       B
 Has no hold on me
.         C#m      A
 Whom the Son sets free
.      E    B
 Oh is free indeed

[V4]
 See the stone is rolled away
 Behold the empty tomb
 Hallelujah, God be praised
 He's risen from the grave
