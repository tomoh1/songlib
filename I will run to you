  <lyrics>[V1]
 Your eye is on the sparrow
 And Your hand, it comforts me
 From the ends of the earth to the depths of my heart
 
[V2]
 Let Your mercy and grace be seen
 You call me to Your purpose as angels understand
 For Your glory may You draw
 All men as Your love and grace demand

[C]
 And I will run to You, to Your words of truth
 Not by might, not by power but by the Spirit of God
 Yes, I will run the  race â€˜til I see Your face
 Oh, let me live in the glory of Your grace</lyrics></song>
