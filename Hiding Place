.G C Em D

[V1]
.G                               C     Em     D
 In the shadow I can hear Your voice singing to me
.G                               C     Em      D      C
 In the valley I can hear Your heart reaching for me now
.       D                       C              D
 And I weep flooded with the strength of Your peace

[C]
.G                         C 
 Youâ€™re my defender, the shield of my heart
.Em                  D
 You are my hiding place
.      G                        C 
 When terror surrounds me, You keep me from harm
.Em                  D 
 You are my hiding place
 
[V2]
 In the darkness I can feel Your light wrap around me
 In my suffering I can feel Your joy rising in me now
 And I weep flooded with the strength of Your peace

[P]
.                 C              D
 Here before You Jesus in this place
.                 C           D
 Here before You now face to face
 
[Outro]
.G                 C 
 Under the shelter of the most High
.Em                  D              G
 Will I be safe and will I abide</lyrics></song>
