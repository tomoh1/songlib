  <lyrics>[V1]
.   A        B      C#m
 I have not much to offer You
.     A         B     C#m
 Not near what You deserve
.      A      B       C#m
 But still I come because Your cross
.      A        B     E
 Has placed in me my worth
 
[V2]
 Oh Christ, my King of sympathy
 Whose wounds secure my peace
 Your grace extends to call me friend
 Your mercy sets me free
 
[C]
.       A        B
 And I know I'm weak, 
.   C#m      C#m/G#      A     B        C#m
 I know I'm unworthy to call upon your name
.        A        B
 But because of grace
.   C#m         C#m/G#     A          B   E
 Because of Your mercy I stand here unashamed
 
[V3
 I can't explain this kind of love
 I'm humbled and amazed
 That You'd come down from heaven's height
 And greet me face to face
 
[T]
.       E            A
 Here I am, at your feet
.        E            A
 In my brokeness complete</lyrics>
