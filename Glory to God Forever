.D A E F#m

[V1]
.A/C#        D         A                 E
 Before the world was made, before you spoke it to be
.A/C#          D       A              E
 You were the King of Kings, Yes you were,  yes you were
.A/C#                D     A                 E
 And now youâ€™re reigning still,  Enthroned above all things
.A/C#                D   A                E
 Angels and saints cry out, We join them as we sing


[C]
.D        A      E      F#m
 Glory to God, Glory to God
.D         A        E
 Glory to God, Forever
.D        A      E      F#m
 Glory to God, Glory to God
.D         A        E
 Glory to God, Forever


[V2]
 Creator God You gave me breath so I could praise
 Your great and matchless name, all my days, all my days
 So let my whole life be a blazing offering
 A life that shouts and sings the greatness of the King


[B]
.D                 A
 Take my life and let it be
.E               F#m
 All for you and for your glory
.D                 A          E
 Take my life and let it be yours</lyrics></song>
