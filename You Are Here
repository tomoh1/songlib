  <lyrics>[V1]
. F#m
 There is a love that I know 
. F#m
 A strength for the weak and the broken heart 
.F#m 
 My Shepherd and King 
. D 
 I find You within me 
. F#m 
 For You are here 

[V2]
.
 You carried the cross for the world 
.
 Gathered the lost and the fatherless 
.
 My Shepherd and King 
.
 I find You within me 
.
 For You are here 
.
 My Lord, forever, You are here 

[C]
.
 In this place, You are here 
.
 By Your mercy, I draw near 
.
 In my heart, take Your place 
.
 You are here

[V3]
.
 Your word is the light of the earth 
.
 Your glory resounds in the universe 
.
 My Shepherd and King 
.
 I find You within me 
.
 For You are here 
.
 My Lord, forever, You are here 

[B]
.
 The same power that conquered the grave 
.
 Lives in me, lives in me 
.
 Your love that rescued the earth 
.
 Lives in me, lives in me 
.
 You are here</lyrics></song>
