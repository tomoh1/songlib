.D   Bm7  Asus 
.D   Bm7  Asus

[V1]
.D  Em  D/F#  G A   D
 Holy    Uncreated One
.        G   D/F#      A
 Your beauty fills the skies
.       D   A/C#       Bm7   A
 But the glory of Your majesty
.        G     A      D      
 Is the mercy in Your eyes

[V2]
 Worthy Uncreated One
 From heaven to earth come down
 You laid aside Your royalty
 To wear the sinner's crown

[C]
.A                 G    D
 O Great God, be glorified
.     A
 Our lives laid down
.       G     D
 Yours magnified
.A                G   A  Bm7
 O Great God, be lifted high
.G         A         D
 There is none like You

[V3]
 Jesus, Savior, God's own Son
 Risen, reigning Lord
 Sustainer of the universe 
 By the power of Your word


[V4]
 When we see Your Matchless face
 In speechless awe we'll stand
 There we'll bow with grateful hearts
 Unto the great I Am
