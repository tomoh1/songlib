.D Em G D

[v1]
.D
 Found in Your hands, fullness of joy
.Em                         G                D         
 Every fear suddenly wiped away here in Your presence||
.D
 All of my gains now fade away
.Em                         G                   D
 Every crown no longer on display, here in Your presence
[p]
.Bm        Asus                     G
 Heaven is trembling in awe of Your wonders
.Bm                  Asus                 G
 The kings and their kingdom are standing amazed

[c]
.             D                D/C#
 Here in Your presence, we are undone
.             Bm        Asus                     G
 Here in Your presence, Heaven and Earth become one
.             D                        D/C#
 Here in Your presence, all things are new
.             Bm        Asus                    G
 Here in Your presence, everything bows before You

[b]
.Bm         A          G         D/F#
 Wonderful, beautiful, glorious, matchless in every way
.Bm         A          G         D/F#
 Wonderful, beautiful, glorious, matchless in every way</lyrics></song>
