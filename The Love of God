.D
 The love of God is greater far
.                A            D
 Than tongue or pen can ever tell
.D
 It goes beyond the highest star
.             A  G          D
 And reaches to the lowest hell

[C1]
.G                                  D
 The guilty pair, bowed down with care
.               A G    D
 God gave His Son to win
.G                         Bm
 His erring child He reconciled
.               A G     D
 And pardoned from his sin

[V2]
 Could we with ink the ocean fill
 And were the skies of parchment made
 Were every stalk on earth a quill
 And every man a scribe by trade

[C2]
 To write the love of God above
 Would drain the ocean dry 
 Nor could the scroll contain the whole
 Though stretched from sky to sky

 Hallelujah

 Hallelujah

[C3]
 O love of God, how rich and pure!
 How measureless and strong!
 It shall forevermore endure
 The saints' and angels' song</lyrics></song>
