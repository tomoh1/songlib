  <lyrics>[V1]
  Oh Lord, my heart longs to be
  A habitation fit for Thee
  A place where peace reigns and love can flourish
  A heart where You can feel at home

[V2]
  Oh Lord, I want to be like You
  My tongue to speak the words You do
  My hands to stretch forth in healing others
  My feet to carry the Good News

[c1]
  That You are God, You're the Way
  You're the Truth and You're the Life
  King of kings, Lord of lords, Prince of Peace, Lord Jesus Christ

[c2]
  And by Your shed blood, the Great Redeemer
  You saved my soul, You paid the price

[c3]
  And by Your shed blood, the Great Redeemer
  You saved my soul, You paid the price
  You saved my soul, now have my life</lyrics></song>
