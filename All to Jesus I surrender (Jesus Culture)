 All to Him I freely give
.C            Em                          Am
 I will ever love, and trust Him with my heart

 In His presence daily live

 All to Jesus I, I surrender all
 Humbly at His feet I bow
 Pleasures of this world, I would gladly trade
 Take it all Lord, take me now

 All to Jesus I, I surrender all
 Oh to feel thy sacred flame
 Love?s salvation born, filling us with joy
 Glory, glory to His Name!
