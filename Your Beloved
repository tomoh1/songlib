.E           G#m
 Lord it was You who 
.A            E    B
 Created the heavens
.E            G#m
 Lord it was Your hand 
.A                             B
 That put the stars in their place||
.E           G#m
 Lord it is Your voice 
.A                  E   B
 That commands the morning
.      C#m  B/D#        E       
 Even oceans and their waves 
.              B     A
 Bow at Your feet

.F#m         C#m
 Lord, who am I

 Compared to Your glory, oh Lord?

 And You love me as I am

 You have called me chosen

 For Your kingdom

 Unashamed to call me Your own

 I am Your beloved
