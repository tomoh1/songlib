.D  Em7  D/F# G  D              A  D
 I have a Maker, He formed my heart
.D  Em7      D/F#    G       D       A       D   G A
 Before even time began my life was in His hands

[C]
.G     D      A   D G   D        A      D     G
 He knows my name,   He knows my every thought
.G   D         A         Bm            G        A     D
 He sees each tear that falls, and He hears me when I call

[V2]
 I have a Father He calls me His own
 He'll never leave me no matter where I go
