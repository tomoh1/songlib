.G             D                Em
 You are my strength when I am weak
.             G/B             C
 You are the treasure that I seek
.            G  D   G D G
 You are my all in all
.            D              Em
 Seeking You as a precious jewel
.              G/B          C
 Lord, to give up Iâ€™d be a fool

[v2]
 Taking my sin, my cross, my shame
 Rising again, I bless Your name
 You are my all in all
 When I fall down, You pick me up
 When I am dry, You fill my cup
 You are my all in all</lyrics>
