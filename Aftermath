  <lyrics>[V1]
.
 The skies lay low where You are
.
 On the earth You rest Your feet
.
 Yet the hands that cradle the stars
.
 Are the hands that bled for me

[C]
.
 In that moment of glorious surrender
.
 You were broken for all the world to see
.
 Lifted out of the ashes
.
 I am found in the aftermath

[V2]
.
 Freedom found in Your scars
.
 In Your grace my life redeemed
.
 For You chose to take the sinner's crown
.
 As You placed Your crown on me

[C2]
.
 In that moment of glorious surrender
.
 Was the moment You broke the chains in me
.
 Lifted out of the ashes
.
 I am found in the aftermath

[C3]
.
 And in that moment You opened up the heavens
.
 To the broken, the beggar and the thief
.
 Lifted out of the wreckage
.
 I find hope in the aftermath

[B]
.
 And I know that You're with me
.
 Yes, I know that You're with me here
.
 And I know Your love will light the way

[C4]
.
 Now all I have I count it all as loss
.
 But to know You and to carry the cross
.
 Knowing I'm found
.
 In the light of the aftermath</lyrics></song>
