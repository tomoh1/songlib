  <lyrics>[V1]
.
 All these pieces, broken and scattered
.
 In mercy gathered, mended and whole
.
 Empty handed, but not forsaken
.
 I've been set free
.
 I've been set free

[P1]
.
 Amazing grace how sweet the sound
.
 That saved a wretch like me
.
 Woah, I once was lost, but now I am found
.
 Was blind but now I see

[C]
.
 Oh, I can see you now
.
 Oh, I can see the love in your eyes
.
 Laying yourself down
.
 Raising up the broken to life

[V2]
.
 You take our failure, you take our weakness
.
 You set your treasure in jars of clay
.
 So take this heart Lord
.
 I'll be your vessel
.
 The world to see your life in me
