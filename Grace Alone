Bm                                     D And in love, before you laid the world’s foundation,.        Bm                           G You predestined to adopt me as your own..           Bm      D      A     F#m       G You have raised me up so high above my station.       Bm               A                D I’m a Child of God By Grace, And Grace Alone[V2] You left your home to seek out the lost; You knew the great and terrible cost But Jesus, your face was set. I worked my fingers down to the bone; But nothing I did could ever atone, But Jesus, you paid my debt.|| By your blood I have redemption and salvation. Lord you died that I might reap what you have sown, And you rose that I might be a new creation. I am born again by grace, and grace alone.[B].G  Asus4 Bm  Asus4              I was in darkness all of my life, I never knew the day from the night, But Spirit, you made me see. I swore I knew the way on my own; head full of rocks, a heart made of stone But Spirit, you moved in me.||.Gmaj7  Asus4 Bm And At your touch my sleeping spirit was awakened; On my darkened heart the light of Christ has shone. Called into a kingdom that cannot shaken Heaven’s citizen by grace, and grace alone.</lyrics>  <author></author>  <copyright></copyright>  <hymn_number></hymn_number>  <presentation></presentation>  <ccli></ccli>  <capo print="false"></capo>  <key></key>  <aka></aka>  <key_line></key_line>  <user1></user1>  <user2></user2>  <user3></user3>  <theme></theme>  <linked_songs/>  <tempo></tempo>  <time_sig></time_sig>  <backgrounds resize="screen" keep_aspect="false" link="false" background_as_text="false"/></song>
