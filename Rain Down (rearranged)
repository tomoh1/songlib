[V1]
.            Am    C             F
 Looks like tonight, the sky is heavy
.                Am  C            F
 Feels like the winds are gonna change
.            Am  C              F
 Beneath my feet, the earth is ready
.            Am C               F 
 I know its time for heaven's rain
.            C (C-B-C-D)
 It's gonna rain
 
[P]
;Bassline
.(F-B-C-D)
.F
 'cause it's living water we desire
 To flood our hearts with holy fire
 
[C]
.C
 Rain down all around the world we're singing
.F
 Rain down can you here the earth is singing
.C
 Rain down my heart is dry but still I'm singing
.F
 Rain down rain it down
 
[V2]
 Back to the start, my heart is heavy
 Feels like it's time, to dream again
 I hear your voice, and yes I'm ready
 To dance upon this barren land
 Hope in my hands

[Ending]

.C
 Give me strength to cross the water
.C
 Keep my heart upon your altar
.F
 Rain down
.C
 Give me strength to cross this water
.C
 Keep my feet donâ€™t let me falter
.F
 Rain down

.Am      Em        F
 Do not shut the heavens
.     Am            Em     F
 But open up our hearts, open up our hearts
.Am      Em        F
 Do not shut the heavens
.     C            G     Am           F
 But open up our hearts, open up our hearts</lyrics></song>
