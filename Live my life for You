.G                C
 Lord, I want to be 
.             G/B          
 Pleasing to You 
.                 D
 In everything I do
.G                       C
 And I want to love You more, 
.                  G/B
 More than yesterday,
.                      D
 More than words can say. 

[C]
.            G
 â€˜Cause You gave Your life
.     G/F#              Em       C
 You lived and died for me, for me. 
.     G
 You paid the price
.     G/F#          Em       C
 You sacrificed for me, for me. 
.             Am               G/B  C
 And now the least that I can do 
.    D                G
 Is live my life for You</lyrics></song>
