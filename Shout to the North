 Of the great and glorious King

 Rise up women of the truth
 Stand and sing to the broken hearts
 Who can know the healing power
 Of oue awesome King of love

[V3]
 We've been through fire, we've been through rain
 We've been refined by the power of Your name
 We've fallen deeper in love with You
 You've burned the truth on our lips!

[V4]
 Rise up church, with broken wings
 Fill this place with songs again
 Of our God Who reigns on high
 By His grace, again we'll fly</lyrics></song>
