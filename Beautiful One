 Wonderful, so wonderful
.    D/F#
 Is Your unfailing love
.G                      A         Bm7
 Your cross has spoken mercy over me

 No eye has seen, no ear has heard

 How glorious, how beautiful you are!

 Displayed for all to see
 The glories of Your majesty
 Awakens my heart to sing
 How marvelous, how wonderful You are!
