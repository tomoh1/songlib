  <lyrics>[V1]
.
 You call me out upon the waters
.
 The great unknown where feet may fail.
.
 And there I find You in the mystery
.
 In oceans deep my faith will stand

[C]
.
 And I will call upon Your name
.
 And keep my eyes above the waves
.
 When oceans rise my soul will rest in Your embrace
.
 For I am Yours and You are mine

[V2]
.
 Your grace abounds in deepest waters
.
 Your sovereign hand will be my guide
.
 Where feet may fail and fear surounds me
.
 You've never failed and you won't start now

[B]
.
 Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
.
 Let me walk up upon the waters wherever You would call me
.
 Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
.
 And my faith will be made stronger in the presence of my Savior
