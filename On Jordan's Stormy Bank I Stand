  <lyrics>[v1]
 On Jordan's stormy banks I stand
 And cast a wishful eye
 To Canaan's fair and happy land
 Where my possessions lie
[v2]
 All o'er those wide extended plains
 Shines one eternal day
 There God, the Son forever reigns
 And scatters night away.
[c]
 I am bound, I am bound, I am bound for the Promised Land
 I am bound, I am bound, I am bound for the Promised Land
[v3]
 No chilling wind nor poisonous breath
 Can reach that healthful shore
 Where sickness, sorrow, pain and death
 Are felt and feared no more
[v4]
 When shall I see that happy place
 And be forever blessed
 When shall I see my Father's face
 And in His bosom rest</lyrics></song>
