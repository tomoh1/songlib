 Who's the King of the jungle?
.                      G
W ho's the King of the sea?
.
 Who's the King of the universe?
.                   C
 The jungle and the sea?

[C]
.C
 I tell you J-E-S-U-S, Yes!
.                 G
 He's the King of me.
.
 He's the King of the universe
.                   C
 The jungle and the sea.

[V2]
 Who's the King of the back yard?
 Who's the King of the house?
 Who's the King of the universe?
 The backyard and the house?

[V3]
 Who's the King of the trees?
 Who's the King of the swamp, chomp?
 Who's the King of the universe?
 The trees and the swamp?</lyrics></song>
