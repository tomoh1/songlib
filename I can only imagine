  <lyrics>[V1]
.            E
 I can only imagine what it will be like
.        A2
 When I walk by Your side
.             E
 I can only imagine what my eyes will see 
.           A2
 When Your face is before me
.             E                   A2
 I can only imagine, I can only imagine

[C]
.     A2                         B
 Surrounded by Your glory, what will my heart feel?
.        E
 Will I dance for You Jesus or in awe of You be still?
.         A2                            B
 Will I stand in Your presence, to my knees will I fall?
.        E
 Will I sing hallelujah, will I be able to speak at all?
.             A2    B             E
 I can only imagine, I can only imagine

[V2]
 I can only imagine when that day comes
 And I find myself standing in the Son
 I can only imagine when all I will do
 Is forever, forever worship You
 I can only imagine, I can only imagine</lyrics></song>
