.       A                    F#m
 Your blood speaks a better word
.                     A                          F#m
 Than all the empty claims I've heard upon this earth
.                          E
 Speaks righteousness for me
.                    D
 And stands in my defense
.                  A  F#m E
 Jesus it's Your blood
 
[C]
.A
 What can wash away our sins?
.F#m
 What can make us whole again?
.E
 Nothing but the blood
.D                         A   E D
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus||
.A
 What can wash us pure as snow?
.F#m
 Welcomed as the friends of God
.E
 Nothing but Your blood
.D                            A   E D A
 Nothing but Your blood King Jesus
 
[V2]
 Your cross testifies in grace
 Tells of the Father's heart to make a way for us
 Now boldly we approach
 Not earthly confidence
 It's only by Your blood
 
[C2]
 We praise You for the blood
 We praise You for the blood
 Nothing but Your blood
 Nothing but Your blood King Jesus</lyrics>
