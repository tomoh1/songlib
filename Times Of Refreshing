.E                 A
 Well I thank You Lord that You are my Savior
.E                                                  B
 You’re my strength and You’re the rock on which I stand
.     E                                 A
 You give me life and a grace that’s greater
.         E               B                A
 When I humble myself beneath Your mighty hand

[C]
.            E
 You bring times of refreshing
.            A
 You bring times of refreshing
.            E                         B
 You bring times of refreshing to my soul
.           E
 When I’m weary from the fight
.      A
 And trying to do what’s right
.            E            B           A   E
 You bring times of refreshing to my soul.

[V2]
 For the day will come when we’ll all be gathered
 And the sun will rise with healing in its wings
 And all the years of pain won’t seem to matter
 When our eyes behold our Teacher and our King</lyrics></song>
