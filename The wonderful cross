  <lyrics>[V1]
.D        Dmaj7     G        D
 When I survey the wondrous cross
.D             Em        Bm    A
 On which the Prince of Glory died
.D          Dmaj7    G        D
 My richest gain I count but loss
.D            Em       A       D
 And pour contempt on all my pride

[V2]
 See from His head, His hands, His feet
 Sorrow and love flow mingled down
 Did ever such love and sorrow meet
 Or thorns compose so rich a crown

[C]
.        G          D             G         D
 Oh the wonderful cross, oh the wonderful cross
.         G                 D               A
 Bids me come and die and find that I may truly live
.         G         D            G          D
 Oh the wonderful cross, oh the wonderful cross
.         G               D                   A
 All who gather here by grace draw near and bless Your name

[V3]
 Were the whole realm of nature mine
 That were an offering far too small
 Love so amazing, so divine
 Demands my soul, my life, my all</lyrics></song>
