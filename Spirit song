  <lyrics>[v1]
 O let the Son of God enfold you
 With His Spirit and His love
 Let Him fill your heart and satisfy your soul
 O let Him have the things that hold you
 And His Spirit like a dove
 Will descend upon your life and make you whole

[c]
 Jesus, O Jesus
 Come and fill Your lambs
 Jesus, O Jesus
 Come and fill Your lambs</lyrics>
