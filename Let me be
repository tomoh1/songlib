 Master and creator
.A          E/G#
 Healer and sustainer
.F#m                         E/A
 I will put my trust in You alone||

.E                          E/A
 Teach me to be faithful to confess

[c]

 Let me be open
.          E/A
 Let me be humble
.                F#m                       A
 Let me find the joy of my salvation in Your cross ||

 Let me be broken Whenever I stumble

 Let me remember the great mercy of my God

[v2]
 Give me the full measure of your grace
 As it is reflected in the Word
 Faith and reassurance
 Mercy and endurance
 Carry these to those who haven’t heard

 All my achievements, I lay at your feet

 Alive in your spirit, I’m willing and able

 You make my joy complete</lyrics></song>
