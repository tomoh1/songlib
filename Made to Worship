  <lyrics>[v1]
 Before the day
 Before the light
 Before the world revolved around the sun
 God on high
 Stepped down into time
 And wrote the story of His love for everyone
[p]
 He has filled our hearts with wonder
 So that we always remember
[c]
 You and I were made to worship
 You and I are called to love
 You and I are forgiven and free
[c2]
 You and I embrace surrender
 You and I choose to believe
 You and I will see who we were meant to be
[v2]
 All we are
 And all we have
 Is all a gift from God that we receive
 Brought to life
 We open up our eyes
 To see the majesty and glory of the King
[b]
 And even the rocks cry out
 And even the Heavens shout
 At the sound of His holy name
 So let every voice sing out
 And let every knee bow down
 He is worthy of all our praise</lyrics></song>
