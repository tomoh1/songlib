.A2             F#m
 No greater joy is there than this
.E                                D
 To know for what weâ€™re meant to live
.A2               F#m
 To hold your hand and touch your face
.E                     D
 To find ourselves in love's embrace

[C]
.A2
 I want to stand before the king
.F#m
 Join in the song that heaven sings
.E                                       D
 I want to hold the hand that holds the world
.A2
 I want to know the mystery
.F#m
 Reach out and touch the majesty
.E                                       D
 I want to hold the hand that holds the world

[V2]
.A2             F#m
 No greater love could be bestowed
.E                              D
 That you would name us as your own
.A2                  F#m
 Your daughters sing, Your sons rejoice
.E                   D
 They gather here before your throne

.F#m           E
 You are, You are
.D
 The author of creation
.F#m           E               D
 We are, the children of your heart
.F#m           E
 Your are, You are
.D
 The light of all the heavens
.F#m         E               D
 We rise to worship all your are.</lyrics></song>
