  <lyrics>[v1]
 Holiness, holiness is what I long for
 Holiness is what I need
 Holiness, holiness is what You want from me
[c]
 So take my heart and form it
 Take my mind transform it
 Take my will conform it
 To Yours to Yours O Lord
[v2]
 Righteousness, righteousness is what I long for
 Righteousness is what I need
 Righteousness, righteousness is what You want from me
[v3]
 Faithfulness, faithfulness is what I long for
 Faithfulness is what I need 
 Faithfulness, Faithfulness is what You want from me
[v4]
 Listening, listening is what I long for
 Listening is what I need 
 Listening, listening is what You want from me</lyrics></song>
