.C                      G       C
 Joy to the world! The Lord is come
.     F        G        C
 Let earth receive her King!
.C
 Let every heart prepare Him room
.C
 And heaven and nature sing
.G

.Am               F          G      C
 And heaven, and heaven and nature sing

[V2]
 Joy to the world! the Savior reigns
 Let men their songs employ
 While fields and floods
 Rocks, hills and plains
 Repeat the sounding joy
 Repeat the sounding joy
 Repeat, repeat the sounding joy

[V4]
 He rules the world with truth and grace
 And makes the nations prove
 The glories of His righteousness
 And wonders of His love
 And wonders of His love
 And wonders and wonders of His love
