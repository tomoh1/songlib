  <lyrics>[v1]
 You are good, You are good
 When there's nothing good in me
 You are love, You are love
 On display for all to see
 You are light, You are light
 When the darkness closes in
 You are hope, You are hope
 You have covered all my sin

[v2]
 You are peace, You are peace
 When my fear is crippling
 You are true, You are true
 Even in my wandering
 You are joy, You are joy
 You're the reason that I sing
 You are life, You are life,
 In You death has lost its sting

[c]
 Oh, I’m running to Your arms,
 I’m running to Your arms
 The riches of Your love
 Will always be enough
 Nothing compares to Your embrace
 Light of the world forever reign

[v3]
 You are more, You are more
 Than my words will ever say
 You are Lord, You are Lord
 All creation will proclaim
 You are here, You are here
 In Your presence I'm made whole
 You are God, You are God
 Of all else I'm letting go

[b]
 My heart will sing
 No other Name
 Jesus, Jesus</lyrics></song>
