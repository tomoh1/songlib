  <lyrics>[v1]
 Inside, You shine
 Admidst this broken daylight
 Take this darkness
 That I might see Your goodness ||
 My eyes are on the sky
 Show me what You hold
 You are the light of my soul

[c]
 You have been the beauty in the song I sing
 The fragrance of the rain
 You have been the mystery in my deepest dreams
 You make me fly away ||
 You have been more faithful than the morning sun
 You've given me the stars
 Take my life
 Take my soul
 Take my heart

[v2]
 You make me, You break me
 You've changed my life completely
 Always, my days
 I'll freely give You my praise ||
 My life (heart) is in Your hands
 Let me feel Your touch
 Lord, I live for Your love
