.C
 There's a cry in my heart
.G
 For your glory to fall
.Dm                           Gsus  G
 For your presence to fill up my senses
.C
 There's a yearning again
.G
 A thirst for discipline
.Dm                              Gsus G
 A hunger for things that are deeper

[b]
.Am                  F
 Could you take me beyond
.C                     G
 Could you carry me through
.Am                F
 If I opened my heart
.C                     G
 Could I go there with you
.Am                    F
 For I've been here before
.C                         G
 Yet I know there's still more
.Dm                      G
 O Lord, I need to know you

[c]
.                F
 For what do I have
.                     C
 If I don't have you Jesus
.              G
 What in this life
.              Am
 Could mean anymore
.            F
 You are my rock
.              C
 You are my glory
.             G        F    Am
 You are the lifter of my head</lyrics></song>
