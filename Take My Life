.D                 A     Bm
 Take me life and let it be
.G  D/F#   Em   A      D
 Consecrated Lord to Thee
.D                A      Bm
 Take my moments and my days
.G   D/F#   Em      A         D
 Let them flow in ceaseless praise
.C                 G/B
 Take my hands and let them move
.Em             A       D
 At the impulse of Thy love
.D                 A        Bm
 Take my feet and let them be
.G    D/F#   Em    A        D
 Swift and beautiful for thee

[V2]
 Take my voice and let them sing
 Always only for my king
 Take my lips and let them be
 Filled with messages from Thee
 Take my silver and my gold
 Not a mite would I withold
 Take my intellect and use
 Every power as You choose

[C]
.        Em G
 Here am I
.       A
 All of me
.         Em  G
 Take my life
.              A
 It's all for Thee

[V3]
 Take my will and make it Thine
 It shall be no longer mine
 Take my heart it is Thine own
 It shall be Thy royal throne
 Take my love my Lord, I pour
 At your feet its treasure store
 Take myself and I will be
 Ever only all for Thee</lyrics></song>
