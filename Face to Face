  <lyrics>[V]
.    G
 My Jesus I love You
.    Em
 For when I was blind and lost
.    C
 You shed for all your enemies
.       D
 Your blood upon the cross||

.    G
 Because You have loved me
.Em
 Now I can love You too
.      C
 Your love goes deep into my heart
.        D
 Then I send it back to You

[V2]
.     G         C         D              G
 And Jesus our love will only grow much deeper
.     Em         C            Dsus          D
 Sustained from above by Your overflowing grace
. G         C        D                G
 Jesus our love will only grow much sweeter
.     C               Am           D       G
 And someday we shall be together face to face
