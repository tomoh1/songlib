.                    G
 I’m gonna trust in God, I’m gonna trust in Jesus
.          D                G
 Without shame and without fear
.                  G
 I’m gonna fix my eyes on the hope of glory
.          D            G F C
 For this day is drawing near

.  G             D           Am
 How great is the love of God

 How steady   is His hand
.      Am7                     Dsus D
 To guide me through this world
.           G                  D       Am
 And though I am weak in Him I'll stand
.         F/A      G/B       C      D Am
 And you will hear me say today in faith

[v2]
 Now when cares of life seem overwhelming
 And my heart is sinking down
 I’m gonna lift my hands to the one who’ll help me
 To the one who holds my crown</lyrics></song>
