[V1]
.            D                  A
 Take these hands and lift them up
.            Bm                                   G
 For I have not the strength to praise You near enough
.        D               A
 I have nothing, I have nothing
.         D
 Without You

[V2]
 Take my voice, and pour it out
 Let it sing the songs of mercy I have found
 I have nothing, I have nothing
 Without You

[C]
.        G     D
 All my soul needs
.             G             Bm
 Is all Your love to cover me
.            G          D
 So all the world will see
.             A               D
 That I have nothing without You

[V3]
 Take my body, and build it up
 May it be broken as an offering of love
 For I have nothing, I have nothing
 Without You

[C2]
 All my soul needs
 Is all Your love to cover me
 So all the world will see
 That I have nothing...

[B]
.   Bm       A  G
 I love You
.             Bm   A  G
 With all my heart
.             Bm   A  G
 With all my soul
.             Bm   A  Em
 With all my mind
.               A              
 And all the strength that I can find

[V4]
 Take my time here on this earth
 Let it glorify all that You are worth
 I am nothing, I am nothing
 Without You</lyrics></song>
