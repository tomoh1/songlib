.C
 You spread out the skies over empty space
.Em
 Said "let there be light"
.                                             C    D
 To a dark and formless world Your light was born

.C
 You spread out Your arms over empty hearts
.Em
 Said "let there be light"
.                                           C   D
 To a dark and hopeless world Your son was born

[P]
.     Am                G/B              C
 You made the world and saw that it was good
.     Am             G/B             C   D
 You sent Your only son for You are good

[C]
.                  C
 What a wonderful Maker
.                  Em
 What a wonderful Savior
.                    C      D
 How majestic Your whispers
.                 G
 How humble Your love
.                        C
 With a strength like no other
.                    Em
 And the heart of a Father
.                    C       D
 How majestic Your whispers
.                  G
 What a wonderful God

[V2]
 No eye has fully seen how beautiful Your cross
 And we have only heard
 The faintest whispers of how great You are
