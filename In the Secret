.G                             C    Em                 D        C
 In the secret, in the quiet place, in the stillness, You are there
.G                             C
 In the secret, in the quiet hour I wait only for You
.Em                D        C
 ‘Cause I want to know You more

[c]
.G               D      Em      C
 I want to know You, I want to hear Your voice
.G          D        C
 I want to know You more
.G          D         Em         C
 I want to touch You, I want to see Your face
.G          D        C
 I want to know You more

[v2]
 I am reaching for the highest goal, that I might receive the prize
 Pressing onward, pushing every hindrance aside, out of my way
 ‘Cause I want to know You more</lyrics></song>
