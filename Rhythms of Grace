.F#m D A A
.F#m D A A 
.Bm F#m Bm Bm 
.A

[V1] 
.    F#m       D              A 
 My life is a light for Your cause
.   F#m         D             A 
 My will laid aside for Your call
.       Bm              F#m          D 
 And reserved are the depths of my heart
.            A 
 Only for You

 I'm caught in the rhythms of grace
 They overcome all of my ways
 Realigning each step every day
 To live for Your glory
 
[C]
.             E      F#m        D
 And there's none beside You, God
.             E      F#m        D
 And there's none beside You, God
 
[V2]
 You're there in the dark of the night
 While holding the sun and its light
 Through the triumph and trials of life
 There's no one beside You

 Your voice called the stars by their name
 Cause You whispered them all to their place
 To testify of Your wonder and grace
 Both now and forever

[C]
.             E      F#m        D
 And there's none beside You, God
.         E      F#m        D
 There's none beside You, God
.           E       F#m        D
 I live my life to shine Your light
.                E      F#m        D
 Cause there is none beside You, God

 No eye has seen, no ear has heard

 The depths of Your love, Lord

 No mind can fathom the love You deserve

 How great You are!</lyrics></song>
