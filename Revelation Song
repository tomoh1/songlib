  <lyrics>[V1]
.
 Worthy is the, Lamb who was slain
.
 Holy, Holy, is He
.
 Sing a new song, to Him who sits on
.
 Heaven's Mercy Seat

[C]
.
 Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord God Almighty
.
 Who was, and is, and is to come
.
 With all creation I sing, Praise to the King of Kings
.
 You are my everything, and I will adore You
 
[V2]
.
 Clothed in rainbows, of living color
.
 Flashes of lightning, rolls of thunder
.
 Blessing and honor, strength and glory and power be
.
 To You the Only Wise King

[V3]
.
 Filled with wonder, awestruck wonder
.
 At the mention of Your Name
.
 Jesus, Your Name is Power, Breath, and Living Water
.
 Such a marvelous mystery</lyrics>
