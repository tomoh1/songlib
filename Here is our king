  <lyrics>[v1]
 From wherever spring arrives
 To heal the ground
 From wherever searching comes the look itself
 A trace of what we’re looking for
 So be quiet now and wait

[b1]
 The ocean is growing 
 The tide is coming in 
 Here it is

[c]
 Here is our king, here is our love
 Here is our God Who’s come
 To bring us back to him
 He is the one, he is Jesus, Jesus

[v2]
 And what was said to the rose
 To make it unfold
 Was said to me here in my chest 
 So be quiet now and rest

[b2]
 Majesty, finally
 Majesty, finally</lyrics></song>
