.        G              C
 See the scars feel the pain
.         G                                 D
 Know the hurting that they know what's the gain
.                        Em
 Like a winter's driving rain
.                     Am       D
 It falls so hard but who's to blame? ||
.       G            C
 We who know we must go
.         G                       D
 Take the message of the Man long ago
.                     Em
 Tell the people everywhere
.                    Am      D
 To look in faith at One who cares

[C1]
.             G
 And you will see the scars
.                         Em
 See the scars of one who died for you
.                         Am
 See the blood that Jesus shed for you
.                       D
 Take the mercy that He offers you ||
.             G
 Oh can't you see the scars
.                             Em
 Scars that take the sting of death away
.                             Am
 Scars that pay what we would never pay
.                        D
 Scars that promise us a better day
.        G
 See the scars

[V2]
.       G           C
 Take a look take a time
.      G                                D
 See behind the frozen eyes to battered minds
.                          Em
 It's a world of desperate need
.                      Am         D
 And will we simply we watch them bleed ||
.       G            C
 We who know we must go
.         G                         D
 Take the message of the cross long ago
.                     Em
 Tell the people everywhere
.                    Am      D
 To look in faith at One who cares</lyrics></song>
