  <lyrics>[V]
.E            A          E  
 You are the only one I need, I
.     A                 E
 bow all of me at your feet, I
.         A    E   A
 worship you alone.||

 You have given me more than,
 I could ever have wanted 
 and I want, to give you my heart and my soul.

[C]
.E E/G# A
 You alone are Father, and
 You alone are good, and
 You alone are Savior, and
 You alone are God.
