  <lyrics>[v1]
 I'm so secure
 You're here with me.
 You stay the same
 Your love remains
 here in my heart.

[c]
 So close I believe
 You're holding me now,
 in Your hands I belong.
 You'll never let me go; ||
 So close I believe
 You're holding me now
 in Your hands I belong, 
 You'll never let me go.

[v2]
 You gave Your life
 and Your endless love
 You set me free
 And show the way
 now I am found

[b]
 All along You were beside me
 even when I couldn't tell
 and through the years
 You showed me more of You
 more of You </lyrics></song>
