  <lyrics>[v1]
.C               G                D
 Higher than the mountains that I face
.C                 G            D
 Stronger than the power of the grave
.C               G               D
 Constant in the trial and the change
.C            G     D
 One thing, remains
.
 One thing, remains

[C]
.      Em               C
 Your love never fails, never gives up
.G                 D
 Never runs out on me

[v2]
.C              G           D
 On and on and on and on it goes
.C                 G            D
 It overwhelms and satisfies my soul
.C                  G          D
 And I never, ever have to be afraid
.C         G     D
 One thing, remains
.
 One thing, remains

[B]
.   C          G        D
 In death, in life, I'm confident and
.Amaj7          C        G          D
 covered by the power of Your great love
.    C      G             D
 My debt is paid, there's nothing that can
.Amaj7       C          G          D
 separate my heart from Your great love</lyrics></song>
