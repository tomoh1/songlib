.D D G G

[V1]
.D                      G
 Give to the wind your fears
.D                  G
 Hope and be undismayed 
.D                                     G
 God hears your sighs and counts your tears 
.D                            G                
 God will lift up, God will lift up, lift up your head 

[C]
.G             A        Bm
 God will lift up your head (3X)
.G                    D
 -------Lift up your head 

[V2]
.D                       G
 Leave to His sovereign sway 
.D                  G
 To choose and to command 
.Em                              A          
 Then shall we wandering on His way 
.Em                       A
 Know how wise and how strong 
.A
 How wise and how strong

[V3]
.D
 Through waves and clouds and storms, 
.     G
 He gently clears the way 
.D                                        G
 Wait because in His time, so shall this night 
.D
 Soon end in joy 
.G
 Soon end in joy 
.D
 Soon end in joy
.G
 Soon end in joy
