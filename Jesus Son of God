.A D/A  E/A  D/A

[V1]
.A                  D/A
 You came down from heaven's throne
.E/A                       D/A
 This earth you formed was not your home
.F#m                   D               A
 A love like this the world had never known||

 A crown of thorns to mock your name
 Forgiveness fell upon your face
 A love like this the world had never known

[C]
.        A
 On the altar of our praise
.          E/A            A
 Let there be no higher name
.D     A/C#    E
 Jesus Son of God
.          F#m
 You laid down your perfect life
.   E/G#          A
 You are the sacrifice
.D     A/C#    E
 Jesus Son of God
.        D     A/C#    E
 You are Jesus Son of God

[V2]
 You took our sin, You bore our shame
 You rose to life, You defeated the grave
 A love like this the world has never known||

.     A                Bm
 You took our sin, You bore our shame

 You rose to life, You defeated the grave
.   A/E                D/F#           A/C#  D  E
 A love like this the world has never known

[B]
.           D               A          E
 Be lifted higher than all You've overcome
.              D               A     E
 Your name be louder than any other song
.             D              A                 E         
 There is no power that can come against your love
.      D          A/C#
 The cross was enough
.      F#m        E
 The cross was enough
.      D          A/C#
 The cross was enough
.      F#m        E    E    D
 The cross was enough
