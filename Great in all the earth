  <lyrics>[Intro]
.A F#m D E

[V1]
.     A
 The world is Yours and everything in it
.     F#m
 It's all at Your command
.             D           E
 There is no end to Your domain...

[V2]
.      A
 The planets shake, the galaxies tremble
.      F#m
 They turn within Your hand
.            D            E
 There is no end to Your domain
.     D                        E
 No height or depth You don't sustain

[C]
.A
 Great in all the earth is Your glory oh God 
.    F#m 
 The universe declares how amazing You are
.      D            E
 Over history and eternity
.     D                   E
 You alone are Lord and King

[V3]
 The world is Yours and everything in it
 It's all at Your command
 There is no end to Your domain
 No height or depth You don't sustain

[B]

 There is none like You (repeat)
