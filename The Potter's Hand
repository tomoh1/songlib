.G                D/F#             C
 Beautiful Lord, Wonderful Savior, I know for sure
.Cm                  Em
 All of my days are held in Your hand
.Asus       A       Dsus     D
 Crafted into Your perfect plan.
.G                  D/F#
 You gently call me into Your presence,
.C              Cm                 Em       
 Guiding me by Your Holy Spirit.  Teach me, dear Lord,
.        Asus       A      Dsus       D
 To live all of my life, through Your eyes.

.Em                    D/F#
 I’m captured by Your holy calling.
.G                C/G          G     Em
 Set me apart; I know You’re drawing me to Yourself.
.Asus      A       Dsus  D
 Lead me, Lord, I pray.

.G         D/F#    Am   D   Em
 Take me, mold me, use me, fill me.
.F              C/E              Am   Dsus  D
 I give my life to the Potter’s hand.
.G         D/F#      Am       D      Em
 Call me, guide me, lead me, walk beside me.
.F              C/E              Am     Dsus  D   G
 I give my life to the Potter’s hand.
