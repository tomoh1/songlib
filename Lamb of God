  <lyrics>[V1]
.D
 Your only Son, no sin to hide
.        F#m    Bm7    F#m        A
 But You have sent Him from Your side
.   F#m    G       D/F#     Em7
 To walk upon this guilty sod
.   D/F#   G       D/A   A   D
 And to become the Lamb of God

[V2]
 Your gift of Love, they crucified 
 They laughed and scorned him as he died
 The humble King, they named a fraud
 And sacrificed the Lamb of God

[C]
.    A       Bm7        G       D
 Oh Lamb of God, Sweet lamb of God 
.      F#m   Bm7   F#m    A
 I love the Holy Lamb of God
.    F#m    G       D/F#      Em7
 Oh wash me in His precious Blood
.    D/F#    G       D/A   A   D
 My Jesus Christ the Lamb of God

[V3]
 I was so lost I should have died 
 But You have brought me to Your side
 To be led by Your staff and rod
 And to be called a lamb of God</lyrics></song>
