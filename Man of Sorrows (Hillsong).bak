.C               F       C
 Man of sorrows, Lamb of God
.F      C       G
 By His own betrayed
.    Am             F        Am
 The sin of man and wrath of God
.    F       G    C
 Has been on Jesus laid

[V2]
 Silent as He stood accused
 Beaten, mocked and scorned
 Bowing to the Father's will
 He took a crown of thorns

[C]
.         Am     F            C G
 Oh, that rugged cross, my salvation
.           Am          F       G
 Where your love poured out over me
.       Am         C        G Am
 Now my soul cries out hallelujah
.           F     G   C
 Praise and honor unto Thee

[V3]
 Sent of heaven, God's own Son
 To purchase and redeem
 And reconcile the very ones
 Who nailed Him to that tree
---
[B]
.       Am      F
 Now my debt is paid
.      C       G
 It is paid in full
.       Am       F
 By the precious blood
.        C     G
 That my Jesus spilled ||
.        Am       F
 Now the curse of sin
.       C       G
 Has no hold on me
.         Am       F
 Whom the Son sets free
.      C    G
 Oh is free indeed

[V4]
 See the stone is rolled away
 Behold the empty tomb
 Hallelujah, God be praised
 He's risen from the grave</lyrics>
