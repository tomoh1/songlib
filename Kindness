  <lyrics>[V1]
.E    B       A            B
 Open up the skies of mercy
.E         B          A
 And rain down the cleansing flood
.E        B      A            B
 Healing waters rise around us
.  A                 B
 Hear our cries Lord, let them rise

[C]
.           A        E         F#m7
 It's Your kindness Lord that leads us to repentance
.      A     E             F#m7
 Your favor Lord is our desire.
.            A     E         F#m7
 It's Your beauty Lord that makes us stand in silence
.          A                   B           E
 And Your love, your love, is better than life.

[V2]
 We can see Your mercy falling
 You are turning our hearts back again
 Hear our praises rise to heaven
 Draw me near Lord, meet us here.</lyrics></song>
