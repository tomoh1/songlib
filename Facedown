.Em                  B
 Welcomed in to the courts of the King
.Gmaj7                         Asus
 I've been ushered in to Your presence
.Em                     B
 Lord, I stand on Your merciful ground
.Gmaj7                           C
 Yet with every step tread with reverence

.          G        C
 And I'll fall facedown
.          Em    D      C
 As Your glory shines around
.           G        C
 Yes, I'll fall facedown
.          Em    D      C
 As Your glory shines around

[V2]
 Who is there in the heavens like You?
 And upon the earth, who's Your equal?
 You are far above, You're the highest of heights
 We are bowing down to exalt You

.C D C D

[B]
.C                        D
 So let Your glory shine around
.                      C
 Let Your glory shine around
.                       D
 King of glory, here be found
