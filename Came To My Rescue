  <lyrics>[V1]
.C
 Falling on my knees in worship
. Am
 Giving all I am to seek Your face
. G/B
 Lord, all I am is Yours

[V2]
. C
 My whole life I place in Your hands
. Am
 God of mercy humbled I bow down
. G
 In Your presence at Your throne

[C]
. C
 I called, You answered
. F
 And You came to my rescue and I
. G/B
 Want to be where You are

[B]
. Am
 In my life be lifted high
. G/D
 In our world be lifted high
. G
 In our love be lifted high</lyrics></song>
