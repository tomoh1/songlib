  <lyrics>[V1]
.
 All the saints and angels bow before Your throne	
.
 All the elders cast their crowns before the Lamb of God and sing

[C]
.
 You are worthy of it all, You are worthy of it all	
.
 For from You are all things, and to You are all things
.
 You deserve the glory

[B]
.
 Day and night, night and day, let incense arise
.
 Day and night, night and day, let incense arise
.
 Day and night, night and day, let incense arise
.
 Day and night, night and day, let incense arise

[T]
.
 I exalt Thee
.
 I exalt Thee
.
 I exalt Thee, oh Lord</lyrics></song>
