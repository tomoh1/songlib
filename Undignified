  <lyrics>[V1]
 I will dance
 I will sing
 To be mad
 For my King
 Nothing Lord
 Is hindering
 This passion in my soul

[C]
 And I'll become
 Even more undignified than this
 Some may say
 It's foolishness
 But I'll become
 Even more undignified than this
 Leave my pride
 By my side ||
 And I'll become
 Even more undignified than this
 Some may say
 It's foolishness
 But I'll become
 Even more undignified than this
 Than this

[B]
 La, la, la, la, la, HEY!
 La, la, la, la, la
 La, la, la, la, la, HEY!
 La, la, la, la, la

 It's all for You my Lord!</lyrics></song>
