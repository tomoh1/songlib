.G                                           C          G
 Some bright morning when this life is o'er, I'll fly away
.G                                   C          G
 To a land on God's celestial shore, I'll fly away

.Em G Em G

[V2]
 When the shadows of this life have grown, I'll fly away
 Like a bird from these prison walls, Iâ€™ll fly, I'll fly away

[C]
.G                        C          G
 I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away
.G                      D/F#   Em  G   D      G   
 When I die, hallelujah by and by, I'll fly away

[V3]
 Oh how glad and happy when we meet, I'll fly away
 No more cold iron shackles on my feet, I'll fly away
 
[V4]
 Just a few more weary days and then, I'll fly away
 To a land where joy will never end, I'll fly away
