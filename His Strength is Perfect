  <lyrics>[v1]
 I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength
 But sometimes I wondered what He can do through me
 No great success to show, no glory on my own
 Yet in my weakness He is there
 To let me know

[c]
 His strength is perfect 
 When our strength is gone
 He'll carry us when we can't carry on
 Raised in His power the weak becomes strong
 His strength is perfect, his strength is perfect

[v2]
 We can only know, the power that he holds
 When we truly see how deep our weakness goes,
 His strength in us begins, when ours comes to and end
 Oh he hears our humble cries and proves again</lyrics></song>
