.                  D2
 Before there was time
.                           Asus A
 There were visions in Your mind
.          Asus     A               Em7
 There was death in the fall of mankind
.                                   G
 But there was life in salvation's design

 Before there were days
 There were nights I could not see Your face
 But the night couldn't keep me from grace
 When You came and You took my place

[c]
.          A    Asus   G              D2
 So I cry holy, only begotten son of God
.           Asus
 Ancient of Days
.       A    Asus    G            D2
 I cry holy, only begotten son of God
.              Asus
 And sing the praises
.        Em7                        G          Asus
 Of the one who saved me, and the promises He made

[v2]
 Before there was time
 You counted the hairs on my head
 You knew all the words that I've said
 And You purchased my back from the dead

 Before I was made
 You searched me and You knew my ways
 You numbered all of my days
 And you set forth the steps that I would take

[b]
.     D2   Asus     Em7   G
 You saved me; You raised me
.     D2   Asus     Em7                 G
 You saved me; You pulled me from the grave</lyrics></song>
