.A/C#          E                B2/D#
 You  rescued me, and picked me up,
.         C#m              G#m
 A living hope of grace revealed
.              A2                E/G#
 A life transformed, in righteousness
.   E   F#m7 E/G#  A  E/G# B
 O Lord, You have rescued me||
.           E                B2/D#
 Forgiving me, You healed my heart
.            C#m               G#m
 And set me free from sin and death.
.                A2                   E/G#
 You brought me life, You’ve made me whole
.   E    F#m7 E/G# A  E/G# B
 O Lord, You have rescued me.

[C]
.         A/E   E            C#m
 And You loved me, before I knew You,
.          A     E/G#    Bsus
 And You knew me for all time.
.           A/E  E        C#m  B     F#m
 I’ve been created in Your image, O Lord,||
.         A/E                C#m
 And You bought me, and You sought me,
.     A           E/G#     Bsus
 Your blood poured out for me,
.         A/E            E/G#    Bsus4
 A new creation in Your image, O Lord
.             A               E  (C#m)
 You rescued me, You rescued me.</lyrics></song>
