  <lyrics>[v1]
 Holiness, Holiness is what I long for
 Holiness is what I need
 Holiness, Holiness is what you want for me
 
[c]
 Take my life and form it
 Take my mind, and transform it
 Take my heat, and conform it
 To youes, to yours, oh Lord
 
[v2]
 Faithfulness, Faithfulness is what I long for
 Faithfulness is what I need
 Faithfulness, Faithfulness is what you want for me
 
[v3]
 Righteousness, Righteousness is what I long for
 Righteousness is what I need
 Righteousness, Righteousness is what you want for me
