.Bm G D A

[V]
.         Bm
 Did You rise the sun for me?
.    G
 Or paint a million stars that I might
.  D                   A
 Know Your majesty?

.          Bm
 Is Your voice upon the wind?
.    G
 Is everything I know marked
.         D                     A
 With my maker's fingerprints?

[P]
.G          Bm
 Breathe on me
.        A         D
 Let me see Your face
.G     A           D
 Ever I will seek You

[C]
.D              A/C#            Bm      G
 'Cause all You are, is all I want, always
.D/F#      A            Bm
 Draw me close in Your arms
.    G                    D
 Oh God, I wanna be with You
.A/C#        Bm   G
 Oh with you

---
[V2]
 Can I feel You in the rain?
 Abandon all I am to have You
 Capture me again

 Let the earth resound with praise
 Can You hear as all creation lives
 To glorify one name?

[T]
.    G                     D  C
 Oh God, I wanna be with you
.                 Bm  G
 I wanna be with you
