  <lyrics>[Intro]
.C#m E B A

[V1]
.C#m             E        B      A 
 Beholding Your beauty is all I long for 
.C#m             E          B     
 To worship You Jesus with my soul's desire 
.      A         E              B               C#m 
 For this very heart You have shaped for Your pleasure

 For the purpose to lift Your name high 

[V2]
.C#m          E         B       A 
 Hear and surrender in pure adoration 
.C#m            E            B             
 I enter Your courts with an offering of praise 
.A          E            B             C#m 
 I am Your servant come to bring You glory

 As is fit for the work of Your hands 

[C]

 Now unto the Lamb
.      E
 Who sits on the throne
.     B                    C#m    A 
 Be glory and honour and praise
.A                  E
 All of creation resounds with the song
.B                                   A
 Worship and praise Him the Lord of Lords

[V3]
.    C#m         E           B          A 
 The spirit now living and dwelling within me 
.C#m           E         B                 
 Keep my eyes fixed ever on Jesus' face 
.A             E             B          C#m 
 Let not the things of this world ever sway me

 I'll run 'till I finish the race

 Holy Lord

 You are Holy 
.C#m  B   A 
 Jesus Christ 
.        E 
 Is the Lord
