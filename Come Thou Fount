  <lyrics>[V1]
.            D               A/D              G        A         D
 Come, Thou Fount of every blessing, Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
.            D             A/D              G        A        D
 Streams of mercy, never ceasing, Call for songs of loudest praise.
.          D              D                D               D
 Teach me some melodious sonnet, Sung by flaming tongues above;
.            D                 A                G      A      D
 Praise the mount, I'm fixed upon it, Mount of Thy redeeming love.

[V2]
 Here I raise mine Ebenezer, Hither by Thy help I come;
 And I hope by Thy good pleasure, Safely to arrive at home.
 Jesus sought me when a stranger, Wandering from the fold of God;
 He to rescue me from danger, Interposed His precious blood.

[V3]
 Oh to grace how great a debtor, Daily I'm constrained to be;
 Let Thy goodness, like a fetter, Bind my wandering heart to Thee.
 Prone to wander, Lord I feel it, Prone to leave the God I love;
 Here's my heart, Oh take and seal it, Seal it for Thy courts above.</lyrics>
