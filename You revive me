.D      Dsus     D     G   Bm   A
 You revive me, You revive me Lord
.    G        D          Bm         A
 And all my deserts are rivers of joy

.D            Dsus     D        G   Bm    A
 You are the treasure, I could not afford
.          G      D            Bm         A
 So I'll spend myself 'til I'm empty and poor
.        G          A        D
 All for you, You revive me Lord

[V1]
.     D
 Lord I have seen Your goodness
.       Dsus             D
 And I know the way You are
.Bm              D/F#             G
 Give me eyes to see You in the dark
.          D
 And Your face shines a glory
.       Dsus          D
 That I only know in part
.     Bm              D/F#
 And there is still a longing
.   G
 A longing in my heart

[V2]
 My soul Lord is thirsty
 Only You can satisfy
 You're the well that never will run dry
 And I'll praise You for the blessing
 For calling me Your friend
 And in Your name I'm lifting,
 I'm lifting up my hands
---
[B]
 I'm alive I'm alive
 You breathe on me
 You revive me
