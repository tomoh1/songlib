.D            A
 Lord take me from this place
.Bm      G                 D
 Into a world that has no time
.            A
 No hurries, no worries
.Bm           G               Em
 Gladly I'd leave them all behind
.      G    Em                   A
 Down here, I'm letting go and drawing near

[C]
.          D            A
 I wanna sing, I wanna fly
.         Bm                        G
 I wanna see from your side of the sky
.         D              A
 I wanna love, I wanna stay
.          Bm
 Wanna be close to you
.       G              D
 Long after the music fades

[V2]
 Lord I come to bring you
 Much more than just a melody
 Please take me and break me
 Right now God, I don't want to leave
 Unchanged, I never want to be the same

[B]
.                 Em          F#m
 'Cause Lord you are Mighty, Awesome, Righteous
.G                   A
 Gracious, Knowing, In me, overflowing
.Em               F#m               G                   A
 Father, Teacher, Master, Leader, Jealous, Loving, You are
