.D E A

[V1]
.                  A
 What mercy was revealed
.                       E
 What selflessness and peace
.                    D
 My fate was surely sealed
.          E       A
 Until He rescued me

.                   A
 His pardon for my sin
.                   E
 His bounty for my need
.                   D
 From slavery and shame
.    E    A
 I am redeemed

[C]
.                     D
 And Heaven can't contain
.          D/F#    E
 The glory of the Son
.      A/C#      D           D/F# E
 Jesus is the Christ, the saving One
.             A/C#    D
 His love has made a way
.            D/F#  E
 The grave is overcome
.     A/C#       D         E     A
 Jesus is the Christ, the saving One

[V2]
 No fear can hold me down
 Nor darkness steal my joy
 For blood has been poured out
 The enemy destroyed
 Death could not hold Him down
 The cross was not enough
 To steal away His throne
 For He is God

.D                D/F#      E
 Anyone who calls upon His name
.         A/C#  D
 They will be saved
.         D/F#  E
 They will be saved
.D                D/F#      E
 Anyone who calls upon His name
.         A/C#  D
 They will be saved
.E             A
 They will be saved</lyrics></song>
