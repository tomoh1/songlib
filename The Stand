.A                   
 You stood before creation 
.  D
 Eternity in your hand 
.A/C#                      F#m
 You spoke the earth into motion 
.                 D
 My soul now to stand 
.A
 You stood before my failure 
.     D
 And carried the cross for my shame 
.    A/C#                    F#m
 My sin weighed upon your shoulders 
.                  D
 My soul, now to stand 

[C]
.                 D    Bm
 So what could I say? 
.                 F#m
 And what could I do? 
.                 D           E
 But offer this heart oh God 
.               F#m
 Completely to you 

[V2]
 So I’ll walk upon salvation 
 Your spirit alive in me 
 This life to declare your promise 
 My soul now to stand 

---
.D A E F#m 

[T]
.D      A
 I’ll stand 
.       E            F#m
 With arms high and heart abandoned 
.D   A          E       F#m
 In awe of the One who gave it all 
.D      A
 I’ll stand 
.    E            F#m          
 My soul Lord to You surrendered
.D     A       E   F#m
 All I am is yours</lyrics></song>
