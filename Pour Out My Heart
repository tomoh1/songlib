  <lyrics>[v1]
 Here I am, once again
 I pour out my heart for I know that You hear
 Every cry You are listening||

 No matter what state my heart is in
 You are faithful to answer
 With words that are true and a hope that is real||

 As I feel Your touch
 You bring a freedom to all that's within
 In the safety of this place I'm longing to

[c]
 Pour out my heart, to say that I love You
 Pour out my heart, to say that I need You
 Pour out my heart, to say that I'm thankful
 Pour out my heart, to say that You're wonderful </lyrics></song>
