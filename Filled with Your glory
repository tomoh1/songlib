  <lyrics>[V1]
.G
 In my heart, in my heart, there's a fire burning
.D                         C
 A passion deep within my soul
.              Am               D
 Not slowing down, not growing cold ||
.G
 An unquenchable flame that keeps burning brighter
.D                               C
 A love that's blazing like the sun
.            Am                   D
 For who You are and what You've done ||

.    C      G/B      D  Am
 And as the fire is raging on
.    C         G/B          D
 So Your praise becomes my song

[C]
.           G
 The whole earth
.                            D
 Is filled with Your glory, Lord
.                 C
 Angels and men adore
.  Am                 D
 Creation longs for what's in store
;(Mountains bow and oceans roar) ||
.         G
 May You be
.                  D
 Honored and glorified
.                    C
 Exalted and lifted high
. Am                  D
 Here at Your feet I lay my life

[V2]
 From the ends of the earth
 To the heights of Heaven
 Your glory, Lord, is far and wide
 Through history You reign on high ||

 From the depths of the sea
 To the mountain's summit
 Your power, Lord, it knows no bounds
 A higher love cannot be found ||

 So let the universe proclaim
 Your great power and Your great name</lyrics></song>
