  <lyrics>[V1]
 May the few be many Lord
 May they see You as You are
 May the narrow road be wide here, wide now
 May Your Kingdom come

[C]
 Glorious and mighty
 Are Your ways in all the earth
 And may Your worth arrayed in glory
 Render hearts that only worship You
 
[b]
 We sing that they might know You Lord</lyrics></song>
