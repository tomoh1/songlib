.A
 Jesus I could Sing
.
 In the tongues of men and angels
.
 But if I have not love
.                                    E
 I am just a clanging cymbal, and empty sound

[C]
.E          A     B5
 This is a love song
.           C#m 
 This is a love song
.        A    B5      E
 Jesus, a love song to You
.           A   B5              C#m
 A song of devotion, a reverent passion
.         A     B5      E
 Savior, a love song to You

[V2]

 Jesus, I could pray
 With a faith that moves a mountain 
 But if I have not love
 It is just a noise resounding, an empty sound

[B]
.A           B                E
 This is a love song to You
.A           B     E
 Hear our devotion

[V3]

 It's the overflow of hearts
 As we gaze upon Your beauty
 A reflection of Your worth
 For we've seen a glimpse of You in Your glory, Lord</lyrics></song>
