[V1]
.E             C#m
 You are more beautiful
.B           A
 Than anyone ever
.E       C#m
 Everyday You're the same 
.B                A
 You never change, no never

.E B C#m A (2x)

 And how could I ever deny
 The love of my Savior
 You are to me everything
 All I need forever
.B             A/C#
 How could You be so good to me?

[C]
.E     B  C#m     A
 There is no one like You
.E          B    C#m       A
 There has never ever been anyone like You

[V2]
 Everywhere You are there
 Earth or air surrounding
 I'm not alone, the heavens sing along
 My God You're so astounding
 How could You be so good to me
 Eternally I believe that'

 How could You be so good to me?
.B               A   
 We're not alone, so sing along
.B               A
 We're not alone, so sing along, sing along, sing along
