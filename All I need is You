  <lyrics>[Intro]
.C#m   F#m  A    B
.C#m   E    Bsus B

[V1]
.C#m                  F#m
 Left my fear by the side of the road
.A                      B
 Hear You speak, won't let go
.C#m                    E                Bsus   B
 Fall to my knees as I lift my hands to pray

[V2]
.C#m                    F#m
 Got every reason to be here again
.A                    B
 Father's love that draws me in
.C#m                    E                   Bsus  B
 And all my eyes wanna see is a glimpse of You

[C]
.               F#m   A
 All I need is You
.               E
 All I need is You Lord
.    B
 Is You Lord (2x)

[V3]
 One more day and it's not the same
 Your Spirit calls my heart to sing
 Drawn to the voice of my Saviour once again

 Where would my soul be without Your Son
 Gave His life to save the earth
 Rest in the thought that You're watching over me

.A E B F#m

[Bridge]
.    A   E     B    F#m
 You hold the universe
.    A   E      B         F#m
 You hold everyone on earth
.    A   E     B    F#m
 You hold the universe
.    A   E
 You hold
.    B
 You hold
