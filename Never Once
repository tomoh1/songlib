.A
 Standing on this mountaintop
.E
 Looking just how far we've come
.F#m
 Knowing that for every step
.D
 You were with us
 
[v2]
.A
 Kneeling on this battle ground
.E
 Seeing just how much You've done
.F#m
 Knowing every victory
.D
 Is Your power in us
 
[p]
.D
 Scars and struggles on the way
.E
 But with joy our hearts can say
.A                      D
 Yes, our hearts can say
 
[c]
.A
 Never once did we ever walk alone
.F#m
 Never once did you leave us on our own
.D            A    F#m            E
 You are faithful, God, You are faithful
 
[c2]
.A
 Never once did we ever walk alone
.F#m
 Never once did you leave us on our own
.D             A    F#m          E
 You are faithful, God, You are faithful
.D             A    F#m          E
 You are faithful, God, You are faithful
 
[b]
.D
 Scars and struggles on the way
.E
 But with joy our hearts can say
.F#m                 E
 Never once did we ever walk alone ||
.D
 Carried by Your constant grace
.E
 Held within Your perfect peace
.F#m                 E
 Never once, no, we never walk alone
 
[c3]
.A
 Every step we are breathing in Your grace
.F#m
 Evermore we'll be breathing out Your praise
.D        A         F#m           E
 You are faithful, God, You are faithful
.D        A         F#m           E
 You are faithful, God, You are faithful
.D        A         F#m           E
 You are faithful, God, You are faithful</lyrics></song>
