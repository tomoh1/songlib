[V]
.         E   F#m          C#m       A
 When we sing,   hear our songs, to You
.          E   F#m         C#m      A
 When we dance,   feel us move, to You
.          E   F#m           C#m         A
 When we laugh,   fill our smiles, with You

[P]
.         E              F#m
 When we lift our voices louder still

 Can You hear us, can You feel?

[C]
.    E                 B/D#              C#m  A
 We love You, Lord, we love You, we love You

 We love You, Lord, we love You, we love You

 When we sing, (LOUD!), hear our songs, to You
 When we dance (ROUND!), feel us move, to You
 When we laugh [ALOUD!], fill our smiles, with You

[B]
.         E               F#m
 And our love is big, our love is loud
. E/G#                  A
 Fill this place with this love now [3x]

.         A                B
 And our love is big, our love is loud
.A/C#               B/D#
 Fill our lungs to sing it now...

[Outro]
 We lift our voices louder still
 Our God is near, our God is here</lyrics></song>
