  <lyrics>[v1]
.        E                    B
 Oh Lord arise, release your power
.             F#m             C#m
 Scatter your foes this very hour
.        A                    E
 May we hold on to your holy commands
.             B             A
 You are the Lord of every man

[v2]
 You hold our lives, you give us breath
 You freed us from the power of death
 You're our salvation, our only hope
 You are the Lord of every man

[c]
.      E                  A               B
 Your voice, it is like thunder over the waters
.      E                  A
 Your voice echoes throughout the Earth
.         B
 We will bow to the sound
.                                  E
 We will bow to the sound of your voice</lyrics></song>
