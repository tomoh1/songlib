.Em C G/B D

[V1]
.Em                   C
 Crown Him with many crowns
.     G/B             D
 The Lamb upon His throne
.      Em        D      A/C#     D
 Hark! How the heavenly anthem drowns
.     Asus   A      D
 All music but its own;
. G/B               C
 Awake my soul and sing
.   A/C#             D
 Of Him who died for me
.     Em      D       C         G/B
 And hail Him as thy matchless King
.   Am7        D    G
 Through all eternity

[C]
.C         G/B
 Majesty, Lord of all
.    C               Em       D
 Let every throne before Him fall
.     C             G/B
 The King of kings, O come adore
.     Am7     G/B       D      G
 Our God who reigns forever - more

[V2]
.Em                 C
 Crown Him Lord of life
.     G/B                 D
 Who triumphed o'er the grave
.     Em      D      A/C#     D
 And rose victorious in the strife
.     Asus     A       D
 For those He came to save;
.      G/B           C
 His glories now we sing
.     A/C#             D
 Who died and rose on high
.     Em    D      C       G/B
 Who died eternal life to bring
.     Am7        D         G
 And lives that death may die

[B]
.    C        G/B     D
 All hail, Redeemer, hail
.    G      G/B       C
 For He has died for me
.      C          G    Em        D
 His praise and glory shall not fail
.       C     D    G
 Throughout eternity</lyrics>
