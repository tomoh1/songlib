[V1]
.C
 We have heard the thunder
.Am
 We have seen the storm
.G
 Echoes of your kingdom coming
.F
 Rumors of our home
.C/E                     F               G
 Where one day we will stand before you Lord
.    Dm          C/E         F
 Our altogether beautiful reward

[C]
.C                     C/B    F/A      G
 And we will give you glory bring you honor
.F               C/E
 King above all kings
.Dm              F
 You deserve our everything
.C                 C/B    F/A        G
 We will lift our voices with your praises
.F         G        C
 Jesus you are our king

[V2]
 Though now we walk in darkness
 Though now we see in part
 Right now we're warmed by the burning flames
 Of the fire in our hearts
 You've promised you would lead us to your throne
 Where we will worship you and you alone

[B]
.C Am G F

 We will give you glory
 We will give you glory
 We will give you glory
 We will give you glory</lyrics></song>
