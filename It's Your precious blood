.G                        C
 You did not buy me with silver
.     D                   G
 You did not redeem with gold
.Em
 But with a treasure
. C                       D
 Far more precious than these(2x)

[C]
.            G        C      D        Bm
 It’s Your precious blood, spilled for me
.Em                          C            D
 You died in suffering and shame upon a tree
.            G        C     D      Bm
 It’s Your precious blood, Lamb of God
.Em                         C       D        G
 You gave Your life so that I could be set free</lyrics></song>
