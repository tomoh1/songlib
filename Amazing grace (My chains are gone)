.A E/A A E/A

[V1]
.  A                 D/A
 Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
.      A                  E/A
 That saved a wretch like me
.  A         A/C#      D       A
 I once was lost, but now I'm found
.      A         E/A   A
 Was blind, but now I see

[V2]
 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
 And grace my fears relieved
 How precious did that grace appear
 The hour I first believed

[C]
.               D                    A/C#
 My chains are gone, I've been set free
.           D                    A/E
 My God my saviour has ransomed me
.             D               A/C#
 And like a flood, His mercy rains
.          Bm  E          A
 Unending love, amazing grace
---
[V3]
 The Lord has promised good to me
 His word my hope secures
 He will my shield and portion be
 As long as life endures

[V4]
 The earth shall soon dissolve like snow
 The sun forbear to shine
 But God, Who called me here below
 Will be forever mine</lyrics>
