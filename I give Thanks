  <lyrics>[v1]
 You have shown me favor undending
 You have given Your life for me
 And my heart knows of Your goodness
 Your blood has covered me
[c1]
 I will arise and give thanks
 To You Lord, my God
 And Your name I will bless
 With my whole heart
[c2]
 You have shown mercy
 You have shown mercy to me
 And I give thanks to You, Lord
[v2]
 You have poured out Your healing upon us
 You have set the captives free
 And we know it's not what we've done
 But by Your hand alone
[b]
 You, O Lord, are the healer of my soul
 You, O Lord are the gracious redeemer
 You come to restore us again
 Yes You come to restore us again...and again</lyrics></song>
