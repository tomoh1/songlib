.E	     F#m A            E

 This is my cry, this is my song
 You are my guiding light when the way is unknown
 And when these sunny skies turn shades of gray
 I'll stay close by Your side as You lead the way

[C]
.	     D  A         E
 Jesus lead on, I will follow
.           D             A              E
 Jesus lead on, let Your love light the way

[V2]
 Hear now this cry, hear now this song
 You are the guiding light for this journey I'm on
 And when my vision is clouded by the wind and the rain
 I'll stay close by Your side as you lead the way</lyrics></song>
