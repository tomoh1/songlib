.D                    G/D   D
 Before the throne of God above,
.D                          F#m
 I have a strong, a perfect plea,
.   D/F#         G     D/F#   A       Bm
 A great High Priest whose name is Love,
.          G6         Em7   G/A D
 Who ever lives and pleads for me.


[C1]
.             G D/F# D       A
 My name is graven on His hands,
.             G  D/F# G  A    Bm
 My name is written on His heart;
.  Bm/A        G   D/F#  A       Bm2
 I know that while in heav'n He stands
.Bm Bm/A       G6     Em7    G/A  Bm
 No tongue can bid me thence depart.
.   Bm/A        G6    Em7    G/A  D
 No tongue can bid me thence depart.
.

[V2]
 When Satan tempts me to despair,
 And tells me of the guilt within,
 Upward I look and see Him there
 Who made an end to all my sin.


[C2]
 Because the sinless Saviour died,
 My sinful soul is counted free;
 For God, the Just, is satisfied
 To look on him and pardon me.
 To look on him and pardon me.
---

[V3]
 Behold him there! the risen Lamb,
 My perfect, spotless Righteousness,
 The great unchangeable I AM,
 The King of glory and of grace!


[C3]
 One with Himself I cannot die,
 My soul is purchased by His blood;
 My life is hid with Christ on high,
 with Christ, my Saviour and my God
 with Christ, my Saviour and my God
