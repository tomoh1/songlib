.      G                 C/E
 At Your Name, the mountains shake and crumble
.      G                 C/E
 At Your Name, the oceans roar and tumble
.      D            Em                C
 At Your Name, angels will bow, the earth will rejoice
.      D
 Your people cry out

.      G
 Lord of all the earth we shout Your Name, shout Your Name

 Filling up the skies with endless praise, endless praise

 Yahweh, Yahweh
.      C                      G
 We love to shout Your Name, Oh Lord
