  <lyrics>[V]
.C/E    F2       Gsus              G
 I'm forgiven, because You were forsaken,
.C/E   F2      Gsus        G
 I'm accepted, You were condemned;
.C/E  F2                  Gsus          G
 I'm alive and well, Your Spirit is within me,
.  F2        G              C
 Because You died and rose again.

.C             F
 Amazing love, how can it be,
.C                              Gsus G
 That You my King would die for me?
.C             F
 Amazing love, I know it's true,
.C                        Gsus G
 And it's my joy to honor You;
.         F G         C
 In all I do to honor You.

[T]
.C  Csus       C
 You are my King,
 You are my King,
 Jesus, You are my King.</lyrics>
