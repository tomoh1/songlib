  <lyrics>[v1]
 Your love is the rock that I cling to
 You name is the tower that I run in to
 Your strength is what lifts my head when it's bowed low
 Your song is the light that shines through my window

[c]
 And like the sun after all of the rain's gone
 The morning without any cloud comes
 With a picture of Your love ||
 And when I think of the stars so high over me
 The moon in the darkness let's everyone see
 A picture of Your love

[p]
 And after the rain has fallen
 And afdter the clouds all roll away
 The sweetest name remains on my soul

[b1]
 You're faithful You're always the same
 You're faithful Lord You never change
 You're faithful You're always good You're always good

[b2]
 And though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
 I have no doubt that You've already gone ahead ||
 By fire by night by cloud by day
 And though ten thousand fall to my right and my left
 Under the shadow of the most high I find my rest
 By fire by night by cloud by day</lyrics></song>
