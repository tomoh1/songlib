  <lyrics>[v1]
 Over all the earth You reign on high
 Every mountain stream, every synset sky
 But my one request, Lord my only aim
 Is that You'd reign in me again

[c]
 Lord reign in me
 Reign in Your power
 Over all my dreams, and in my darkest hour
 You are the Lord of all I am
 So won't You reign in me again

[v2]
 Over every thought, over every word
 May my life reflect the beauty of my Lord
 'Cause You mean more to me 
 Than any earhtly thing
 So won't You reign in me again</lyrics></song>
