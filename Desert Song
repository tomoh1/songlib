.Bm G  Bm G

[V1]
.Bm              A         G
 This is my prayer in the desert
.Bm                 A            G
 And all that's within me feels dry
.Bm                 A     G
 This is my prayer in my hunger and need
.Bm              A       G
 My God is the God who provides

[V2]
 And this is my prayer in the fire
 In weakness or trial or pain
 There is a faith proved
 Of more worth than gold
 So refine me Lord through the flames

[C]
.                   D
 And I will bring praise
.               A
 I will bring praise
.           G                         D
 No weapon formed against me shall remain
.          A
 I will rejoice
.           Bm
 I will declare
.           G          A          Bm
 God is my victory and He is here

[V3]
 And this is my prayer in the battle
 And triumph is still on it's way
 I am a conqueror and co-heir with Christ
 So firm on His promise I'll stand

[B]
.D
 All of my life, in every season
.Bm                                     A
 You are still God, I have a reason to sing
.G                    D
 I have a reason to worship

[V4]
 This is my prayer in the harvest
 When favor and providence flow
 I know I'm filled to be emptied again
 The seed I've received I will sow</lyrics></song>
