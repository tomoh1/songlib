[V]
.  D          A/C#          Bm    Bm/A
 Give me one pure and holy passion
. G             D/F#       Em     Asus A
 Give me one magnificent obsession
. D           A/C#      Bm            Bm/A
 Give me one glorious ambition for my life
.     G      D/F#    Em   A     D G
 To know and follow hard after You

[C]
.     D             G/B          D D/C#
 To know and follow hard after You
.    Bm              G           Asus A
 To grow as Your disciple in the truth
.               Bm              A
 This world is empty, pale and poor
.              Bm              A
 Compared to knowing You, my Lord
.        G               A        Bm
 Lead me on, and I will run after You
.        G               A        D
 Lead me on, and I will run after You</lyrics></song>
