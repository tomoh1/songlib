.     C#m
 As I come into Your presence
.A
 Past the gates of praise
.  C#m
 Into Your sanctuary
.             A              A/C#
 Till weâ€™re standing face to face
.   Bsus           B
 I look upon Your countenance
.          A/C#    A/B        A   E/G#
 And see the wonder of Your grace
           F#m       C#m    Bsus   B
 And I can only bow down and say

[c]

 You are awesome in this place Mighty God
         F#m                   B     E    B
 You are awesome in this place Abba Father
.         E    E/F#    E/G#
 You are worthy of all praise
.    A       E/G#    F#m
 To You our lives we raise

 You are awesome in this place Mighty God</lyrics></song>
