.G G/F# G/E G

[V1]
.             Em     Em/D     G
 No more, my God, I boast no more
.            Bm            C
 Of all the duties I have done;
.           Am   G/B       C
 I quit the hopes I held before,
.              G   G/F# G/E  G
 To trust the merits of Thy Son

[C]
.            C  G
 No more my God,
.            C  Dsus D
 No more my God,
.            Am G/B C D
 No more my God,
.            G   G/F# G/E G
 I boast no more.

[V2]
 Now, for the love I bear His name,
 What was my gain I count my loss;
 My former pride I call my shame,
 And nail my glory to His cross.

[B]
.            Em
 Yes, and I must and will esteem
.               D/F#
 All things but loss for Jesusâ€™ sake;
.          C
 O may my soul be found in Him,
.            Dsus
 And of His righteousness partake!
.Am  G/B   C
 Amen, amen

[V3]
 The best obedience of my hands
 Dares not appear before Thy throne;
 But faith can answer Thy demands,
 By pleading what my Lord has done.</lyrics></song>
