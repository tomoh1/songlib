.  A/C#       D        E                A
 Above all powers  above all kings
.  A/C#       D              E                  A     E/G#
 Above all nature and all created things
.                F#m              E                        D   A/C#
 Above all wisdom and all the ways of man
.Bm7                     D                    E/G#   A
 You were here before the world began||
.  A/C#       D           E                   A
 Above all kingdoms  above all thrones
.  A/C#         D                  E                      A     E/G#
 Above all wonders the world has ever known
.                 F#m             E                       D    A/C#
 Above all wealth and treasures of the earth
.Bm7                         D                            C#sus  C#
 There's no way to measure what You're worth

[c]
.    A  Bm  E/G#                A
 Crucified  laid behind a stone
.         A        Bm  E/G#             A
 You lived to die rejected and alone
.E/G#  F#m   E                        D      A/C#
 Like a rose trampled on the ground
.                     Bm  A/C#
 You took the fall
.                          D   E           A
 And thought of me    above all</lyrics></song>
