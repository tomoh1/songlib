  <lyrics>[V]
 The Lord is gracious and compassionate
 Slow to anger and rich in love

[P]
 And the Lord is good to all
 He has compassion on all that he has made
 
[C]
 As far as the east is from the west
 That's how far he has removed our transgressions from us

[T]
 Praise the Lord, O my soul
 Praise the Lord</lyrics></song>
