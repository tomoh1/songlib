  <lyrics>[V1]
.       A                     D   E      A
 When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,
.      F#m          B           E
 When sorrows like sea billows roll
.    A        D              B7           E
 Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,
.       A           D        E        A
 It is well, It is well, with my soul.

[C]
.       A      E             E     A
 It is well (echo), with my soul (echo).
.       D            A   E       A
 It is well, it is well with my soul.

[V2]
 Though Satan should buffet, thoâ€™ trials should come.
 Let this blest assurance control.
 That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,
 And hath shed His own blood for my soul.

[V3]
 My sin, oh the bliss of this glorious thought,
 My sin not in part, but The whole.
 Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more.
 Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

[V4]
 And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight.
 The clouds be Rolled back as a scroll.
 The trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend,
 Even so, it is well with my soul.</lyrics></song>
