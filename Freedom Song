.      G               C
 When Jesus comes, he comes in power (echo)
.      G                C
 Pour down Your Spirit like a shower (echo) (2x)

 Turn my mourning into dancing (echo)
 Turn my weeping in laughing (echo) (2x)

 Give us freedom and joy in Your presence Lord
.Em             D             G              C

 To my heart</lyrics></song>
