.G         G2           G     G2
 Who will ascend God's holy mountain
.G         G2            G     G2
 Who will abide in His presence
.G          G2           G       G2
 He who is clean and is pure in heart
.G            G2           G            C Cmaj7 C6
 Who does not lift up his soul to any idol
.C                 G    G2  G  G2
 Or speak what is false

[V2]
.G         G2               G       G2
 He will receive blessing from the Lord

 And vindication from God

 Who seeks His face            the God of all

 Lift up your heads, O you gates

 Lift up your heads you ancient doors
.               D                      C             Dsus D
 Lift up your heads that the King of Glory may come in

 That the King of Glory may come in (4x)</lyrics></song>
