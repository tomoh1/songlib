  <lyrics>[v1]
.E
 Who am I that the highest King
.      C#m    B  E
 Would welcome me
.E
 I was lost but He brought me in
.       C#m  B   A
 Oh His love for me
.       C#m  B   A
 Oh His love for me
 
[c1]
.        E                     B
 Who the Son sets free  Oh is free indeed
.      C#m   B  A           E
 I'm a child of God Yes I am
 
[v2]
.E
 Free at last He has ransomed me
.       C#m  B   A
 His grace runs deep
.E
 While I was a slave to sin
.           C#m  B A
 Jesus died for me
.       C#m  B   A
 Yes He died for me

[c2]
.        E                     B

 I'm a child of God Yes I am
.      E                          B
 In my Father's house There's a place for me

 I'm a child of God  Yes I am
 
[B]

 I'm a child of God Yes I am</lyrics>
