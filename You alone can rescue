.A                     D       A
 Who, oh Lord, could save themselves,
.  D                  E
 Their own sin could heal?
.    F#m        A      D       A
 Our shame was deeper than the sea
.      D        E      A
 Your grace is deeper still
 
[C]
.                D      E            F#m
 You alone can rescue, You alone can save
.               D       E         F#m
 You alone can lift us from the grave
.                  D        E             F#m
 You came down to find us, led us out of death
.                D         E       Asus ( F#m ) A
 To You alone belongs the highest praise
 
[V2]
 You, oh Lord, have made a way
 The great divide You heal
 For when our hearts were far away
 Your love went further still
 Yes, your love goes further still

 You’re the Giver of Life

 We lift up our eyes, lift up our eyes

 You’re the Giver of Life
.     F#m
 We lift up our eyes, lift up our eyes
.            D
 You’re the Giver of Life
.     F#m
 We lift up our eyes, lift up our eyes
.            D
 You’re the Giver of Life</lyrics>
