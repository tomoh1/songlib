.     E                            A           B
 How lovely is Your dwelling place,  O Lord Almighty
.E                                  B
 My soul longs and even faints for You ||
.E                              A              B
 For here my heart is satisfied  within Your presence
.   E                            B
 I sing beneath the shadow of Your wings

[C]
.           A
 Better is one day in Your courts
.           B
 Better is one day in Your house,
.           A
 Better is one day in Your courts
.       B
 Than thousands elsewhere (2x)

[V2]
 One thing I ask, and I would seek to see Your beauty
 To find  You in the place Your glory dwells (2x)

[B]
.C#m                       B A                    B
 My heart and flesh cry out,  for You the living God
.C#m            B            A    B
 Your Spirit’s water for my soul ||
.C#m                      B A                  E/G#
 I’ve tasted and I’ve seen,  come once again to me 
.                        F#m                   B
 I will draw near to You, I will draw near to You</lyrics></song>
