.E                      B/D#
 Turn your ear to heaven
.                     A
 And hear the noise inside
.        E
 The sound of angels’ awe
.        B/D#
 The sound of angels’ songs
.        A
 And all this for a king
. B/D#
 We could join and sing
.A
 All to Christ the king

[p]
.B/D#                   A
 How constant how divine

 This song of ours will rise
.B/D#                      A
 Oh how constant how divine
.B/D#                    A
 This love of ours will rise
.A
 Will rise

[v2]
 Turn your gaze to heaven
 And raise a joyous noise
 The sound of salvation come,
 The sound of rescued ones
 And all this for a king
 Angels join to sing
 All for Christ our king

[p2]
 How infinite and sweet
 This love so rescuing
 Oh how infinitely sweet
 This great love that has redeemed
 As one, We sing

[c2]
 Alleluia, Alleluia
 He is holy
 He is holy</lyrics></song>
