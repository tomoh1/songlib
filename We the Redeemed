[V1]
.                       D
 There is nothing like Your love
.                Bm
 No exchange for all You gave
.                     A   G
 To be welcomed into life
.                   D
 So I could know a love that saves
 
[V2]
 Now forever to belong
 To walk with You for all my days
 There's no greater love than this
 You are the Author and the Way

 Rising up to praise the King

 And join with all the saints to sing
 Bringing honour to the King
