  <lyrics>[Intro]
.A D F#m E


[V1]
.F#m                       E      A
 You're the wonder and the mystery
.F#m                     E        A
 You're the melody that must be sung
.F#m                        E    A
 We rejoice with all those who believe
.F#m                           E      A
 You're the song that was and is to come


[P]
.D        F#m   E
 Glory is rising
.     D        F#m   E
 Yeah glory is rising


[C]
.A      D   F#m           E
 Beautiful, beautiful the sound
.     A           D
 Of redemption's song
.F#m                 E
 Moving through the crowd
.         A        D
 Singing great is our God
.      F#m             E
 Your children crying out
.A      D   F#m           E
 Beautiful, beautiful the sound

[V2]
.F#m                        E      A
 From the earth our voices will ascend
.F#m                E    A
 As an offering to You alone
.F#m                   E       A
 May our praises echo without end
.F#m                    E         A
 Join the angel choir around the throne

 Beautiful the sound</lyrics></song>
