  <lyrics>[V1]
 Should nothing of our efforts stand
 No legacy survive
 Unless the Lord does raise the house
 In vain its builders strive

 To you who boast tomorrow’s gain
 Tell me what is your life
 A mist that vanishes at dawn
 All glory be to Christ!

[C]
 All glory be to Christ our king!
 All glory be to Christ!
 His rule and reign we'll ever sing,
 All glory be to Christ!

[V2]
 His will be done
 His kingdom come
 On earth as is above
 Who is Himself our daily bread
 Praise Him the Lord of love

 Let living water satisfy
 The thirsty without price
 We’ll take a cup of kindness yet
 All glory be to Christ!
---
[V3]
 When on the day the great I Am
 The faithful and the true
 The Lamb who was for sinners slain
 Is making all things new.

 Behold our God shall live with us
 And be our steadfast light
 And we shall e'er his people be
 All glory be to Christ!
