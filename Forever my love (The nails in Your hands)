.     G                       Em
 The nails in Your hands the nails in Your feet
.      C                    D
 They tell me how much You love me
.      G                   Em
 The thorns on Your brow they tell me how
.     C                      D
 You bore so much shame to love me

[P]
.Bm                         Em
 And when the heavens pass away
.          Bm                 Em
 All Your scars will still remain
.     Bm                Em               D
 And forever they will say how much You love me
.       D7
 And I want to say

[C]
.   G               Em
 Forever my love forever my heart
.   C                D
 Forever my life is Yours (2x)</lyrics></song>
