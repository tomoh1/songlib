.
 Oh Lord my God in You I put my trust 
.
 Oh Lord my God in You I put my hope 
.
 Oh Lord my God in You I put my trust 
.
 Oh Lord my God in You I put my hope 

[C}
.
 In You In You I find my peace 
.
 In You In You I find my strength 
.
 In You I live and move and breathe 
.
 Let everything I say and do 
.
 Be founded by my faith in You 
.
 I lift up holy hands and sing 
.
 Let the praises ring! 

[V2]

 Oh Lord my God to You I give my hands 
.
 Oh Lord my God to You I give my feet 
.
 Oh Lord my God to You I give my everything 
.
 Oh Lord my God to You I give my life</lyrics></song>
