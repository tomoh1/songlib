  <lyrics>[V]
 Who is there like You?
 Who else would give their life for me,
 Even suffering in my place?
 And who could repay You?
 All of creation looks to You,
 And You provide for all You have made.

[C1]
 So I'm lifting up my hands,
 Lifting up my voice, lifting up Your name,
 And in Your grace I rest
 For Your love has come to me and set me free.

[C2]
 And I'm trusting in Your word,
 Trusting in Your cross, trusting in Your blood,
 And all Your faithfulness
 For Your power at work in me is changing me.</lyrics></song>
