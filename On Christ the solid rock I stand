  <lyrics>[V1]
.    D                A
 My hope is built on nothing less
.      G                A        D
 Than Jesus’ blood and righteousness.
.   D                   A
 I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
.      G             A      D
 But wholly lean on Jesus’ Name.

[C]
.      D              G
 On Christ the solid Rock I stand,
.            D        A
 All other ground is sinking sand;
.    G                A       D
 All other ground is sinking sand.

[V2]
 When darkness seems to hide His face,
 I rest on His unchanging grace.
 In every high and stormy gale,
 My anchor holds within the veil.

[V3]
 His oath, His covenant, His blood,
 Support me in the whelming flood.
 When all around my soul gives way,
 He then is all my Hope and Stay.

[V4]
 When He shall come with trumpet sound,
 Oh may I then in Him be found.
 Dressed in His righteousness alone,
 Faultless to stand before the throne.</lyrics></song>
