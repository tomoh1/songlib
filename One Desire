[V]
.E/G#
 You gave it all for me
.A
 My soul desire, my everything 
.E/G#                 A
 All I am is devoted to You
.E/G#
 How could I fail to see
.A
 You are the love that rescued me
.E/G#                 A
 All I am is devoted to You

[P]
.B                   C#m
 And oh, how could I not be moved 
.       A
 Lord here with You 
.    E               B
 So have Your way in me
.                      C#m
 Cause Lord there is just one thing 
.     A
 That I will seek

[C]
.            E
 This is my cry
.          B
 My one desire
.                     C#m
 Just to be where You are Lord
.           A
 Now and forever
.                  E
 It's more than a song
.          D
 My one desire
.               F#m
 Is to be with You
.               C#m A
 Is to be with You
.E/G#
 Jesus

[B]
.E       F#m
 The one thing
.   E/G#   A     C#m
 The one thing I ask
.       B       E/G#  A
 Is to be with You
