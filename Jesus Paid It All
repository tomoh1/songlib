  <lyrics>[V1]
.   A
 I hear the Savior say
.        E                 A
 "Thy strength indeed is small
.          F#m7                D
 Child of weakness, watch and pray
.         A        E      A
 Find in Me thine all in all"

[C]
.A              F#m7
 Jesus paid it all
.A            E
 All to Him I owe
.A                D
 Sin had left a crimson stain
.    A         E         A
 He washed it white as snow

[V2]
.       A
 Lord, now indeed I find
.     E                A
 Thy pow'r and Thine alone
.     F#m7                D
 Can change the leperâ€™s spots
.     A        E         A
 And melt the heart of stone

[V3]
.      A
 And when before the throne
.    E               A
 I stand in Him complete
.        F#m7            D
 "Jesus died my soul to save"
.    A           E     A
 My lips shall still repeat

[B1]
.       A                Asus
 Oh, praise the One who paid my debt
.      A                  Asus
 And raised this life up from the dead

[B2]
.      A                 D2
 Oh, praise the One who paid my debt
.     Bm7                  D2
 And raised this life up from the dead</lyrics></song>
