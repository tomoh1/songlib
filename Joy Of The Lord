  <lyrics>[V1]
 As the Father loved Jesus, so He loves each of us
 Remain in His love, remain in His ways
 You'll know the joy of the Lord

[V2]
 Obey His commands, stretch out your hands
 Remain in His love, remain in His ways
 You'll know the joy of the Lord

[C]
 The joy of the Lord is my strength, is my strength
 Nothing compares to the love of God, His abounding love

[B]
 Rejoice in the Lord, rejoice in the Lord
 Rejoice in the Lord, Oh the joy of the Lord</lyrics></song>
