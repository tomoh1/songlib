.Em            Am7/C
 Lord of every age
.               G
 Author of our faith
.                       Bm7
 The first the last the same
.                    Em
 The name above all names
.                Am7/C
 Crowned in majesty
.                    G
 Glorious Prince of Peace
.                       Bm7
 Throned at God's right hand
.                      Em
 The world at his command
.                      Am7/C
 The world at his command

 Jesus lamb of God

 How great You are
.            D
 There is no other Savior
.G                C
 Every knee bows down

 At your renown
.            D
 There is no other Savior

[V2]
 Merciful High priest
 Lover of the least
 Generous and meek
 Protector of the weak
 Sacrificed to death
 For us, Your final breath
 You died, the world to save
 To overcome the grave
 To overcome the grave
