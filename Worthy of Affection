.C
 Deliverer you brought us out of the miry clay
.F
 You set our feet upon the rock
.                 C                 F
 And You made us sing, holy is the Lord

.C
 You would declare Your thoughts about us
.       F
 One by one it would be too many to count
.              C                          F
 So we simply come to sing of your great love

[P]
.       G                           F
 So we sing, we lift our hands and sing

[C]
.         C
 You are worthy of affection
.            F                       C
 You're the radiance of all of His glory
.                          F
 Let adoration fill this place
.         C
 You hold everything together
.        F                        C
 By the word of your immovable power
.                       F     C
 We sing this song of praise
---
[V2]
 We are the broken down
 And we are the beaten up
 But what can stop us
 From the song of unending love, Holy is the Lord

 You are the treasure
 The hope, the bright and morning star
 You are the lover of our soul
 And you won our hearts we sing of Your great love

[B]
.C               F     C              F
 Worthy are You Lord, worthy are You Lord
.     C              F            C     F
 Oh, worthy are You Lord of all praise
.C                 F     C                F
 All glory to You Lord, all glory to You Lord
.     C            F           C            F
 All glory to You Lord forevermore, forevermore
