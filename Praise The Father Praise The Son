.             C
 O sovereign God, O matchless King
.             C/E
 The saints adore, the angels sing
.          F                     Am
 And fall before the throne on grace
.         Dm         G         C
 To You belongs the highest praise

[V2]
 These sufferings, this passing tide
 Under Your wings I will abide
 And every enemy shall flee
 You are my hope and victory

[C]
.            F        G         C
 Praise the Father, Praise the Son
.            F      E7/G#     Am
 Praise the Spirit, Three in One
.            F     G       C
 Clothed in power and in grace
.           Dm      G      C
 The Name above all other names

[V3]
 To the valley, for my soul
 Thy great descent has made me whole
 Your word my heart has welcomed home
 Now peace like water ever flows
