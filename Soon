  <lyrics>[V1] 
.D 
 Soon and very soon 
.      Bm 
 My King is coming 
.G 
 Robed in righteousness 
.        Em7 
 And crowned with love 
.D 
 When I see Him 
.          Bm 
 I shall be made like Him 
.G              A     D  Dsus4  D 
 Soon and very soon 

[V2] 
 Soon and very soon I'll be going 
 To the place He has prepared for me 
 There my sin erased 
 My shame forgotten 
 Soon and very soon 

[C] 
.        A/C#          G        D 
 I will be with the One I love 
.         A            Em      G      D 
 With unveiled face I'll see Him 
.                A/C#          Bm   A    G 
 There my soul will be satisfied 
.Em           A     D / / / (G/D / / / 1st x) 
 Soon and very soon 

[V3] 
 Soon and very soon 
 See the procession 
 The angels and the elders 
 'Round the throne 
 At His feet I'll lay my crowns 
 My worship 
 Soon and very soon 

[B]

 Though I have not seen Him

 My heart knows Him well

 Jesus Christ the Lamb

 The Lord of Heaven</lyrics></song>
