  <lyrics>[V1]
.D
 Soon and very soon
.      Bm
 My King is coming
.G
 Robed in righteousness
.        Em7
 And crowned with love
.D
 When I see Him
.          Bm
 I shall be made like Him
.G              A     D  Dsus4  D
 Soon and very soon
 
[V2]
 Soon and very soon I'll be going
 To the place He has prepared for me
 There my sin erased
 My shame forgotten
 Soon and very soon
 
[C]
.      A/C#          G     D
 I will be with the One I love
.     A         Em        G   D
 With unveiled face I'll see Him
.         A/C#        Bm   A    G
 There my soul will be satisfied
.Em        A     D
 Soon and very soon
 
[V3]
 Soon and very soon
 See the procession
 The angels and the elders
 'Round the throne
 At His feet I'll lay my crowns
 My worship
 Soon and very soon
