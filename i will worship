  <lyrics>[v1]
 I will worship (I will worship)
 With all of my heart (With all of my heart)
 I will praise you (I will praise you)
 With all of my strength (With all my strength)
[v2]
 I will seek you (I will seek you)
 All of my days (All of my days)
 I will follow (I will follow)
 Follow all of your ways (All your ways)
[c]
 I will give you all my worship
 I will give you all my praise
 You alone I long to worship
 You alone are worthy of my praise
[v3]
 I will bow down (I will bow down)
 Hail you as king (Hail you as king)
 I will serve you (I will serve you)
 I'll give you everything (I'll give you everything)
[v4] 
 I will lift up (I will lift up)
 My eyes to your throne (My eyes to your throne)
 I will trust you (I will trust you)
 I will trust you alone (Trust you alone)</lyrics></song>
