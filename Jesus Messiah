.G                   Am
 He became sin, who knew no sin
.    G/B                  C
 That we might become His Righteousness
.    G                   Am            G/D
 He humbled himself and carried the cross
.          C       G/D      C
 Love so amazing, love so amazing

[C]

 Jesus Messiah
.           C
 Name above all names
.         G             D
 Blessed Redeemer, Emmanuel
.                G
 The rescue for sinners
.                 C
 The ransom from Heaven
.       G/B    D         G (D)
 Jesus Messiah, Lord of all

[V2]
 His body the bread, His blood the wine
 Broken and poured out all for love
 The whole earth trembled and the veil was torn
 Love so amazing, love so amazing

[B]
.         Am        G/B
 All our hope is in You
.         C          D
 All our hope is in You
.         Am        G/B
 All the glory to You, God

 The light of the world</lyrics></song>
