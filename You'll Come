  <lyrics>[B]
 Chains be broken
 Lives be healed
 Eyes be opened
 Christ is revealed

[V1]
 I have decided
 I have resolved
 To wait upon You, Lord

[V1]
 My rock and redeemer
 Shield and reward
 I'll wait upon You, Lord

[P1]
 As surely as the sun will rise
 You'll come to us
 Certain as the dawn appears

[C]
 You'll come
 Let Your glory fall as You respond to us
 Spirit rain
 Flood into our thirsty hearts again
 You'll come, You'll come

[v2]
 We are not shaken
 We are not moved
 We wait upon You, Lord

[v2]
 Mighty deliverer
 Triumph and truth
 We wait upon You, Lord

[P2]
 As surely as the sun will rise
 You'll come to us
 Certain as Your word endures
