  <lyrics>[V1]
 As I look back on the road I've travelled,
 I see so many times He carried me through;
 And if there's one thing that I've learned in my life,
 My Redeemer is faithful and true
 My Redeemer is faithful and true

[C]
 My Redeemer is faithful and true
 Everything He has said He will do,
 And every morning His mercies are new
 My Redeemer is faithful and true

[V2]
 My heart rejoices when I read the promise
 'There is a place I am preparing for you.'
 I know someday I'll see my Lord face to face,
 'Cause my Redeemer is faithful and true
 My Redeemer is faithful and true</lyrics></song>
