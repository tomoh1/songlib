  <lyrics>[v1]
 Open our eyes
 To see the things that make Your heart cry
 To be the church that You would desire
 Your light to be seen

[v2]
 Break down our pride
 And all the walls we've built up inside
 Our earthly crowns and all our desires
 We lay at Your feet

[p]
 Let hope rise
 Darkness tremble in Your holy light
 That every eye will see 
 Jesus our God great and mighty to be praised

[v3]
 God of all days
 Glorious, In all of Your ways
 Oh the majesty the wonder and grace
 In the light of Your Name

[c]
 With everything, with everything
 We will shout for Your glory
 With everything, with everything
 We will shout forth Your praise

[b]
 Our hearts they cry, be glorified
 Be lifted high above all names
 For You our King with everything
 We will shout forth Your praise
