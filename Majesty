.F#m  E D    A/C#                 D
 Here I am, humbled by Your majesty
.A/C#                         E/G# C#/F
 Covered by Your grace so free
.F#m  E D    A/C#                 D
 Here I am, knowing I’m a sinful man
.A/C#                           E/G# C#/F
 Covered by the blood of the lamb

[P]
.F#m   E    A                        F#m E/G#  A
 Now I’ve found the greatest love of all is   mine
.                          B/D#
 Since You laid down Your life
.                   D
.The greatest sacrifice

[C]
.A     E   F#m7  D
 Majesty, Majesty
.       A                          E
 Your grace has found me just as I am
.       F#m                      D
 Empty handed but alive in Your hands

 Majesty, Majesty
 Forever I am changed by Your love
 In the presence of Your Majesty

[V2]
 Here I am, humbled by the love that You give
 Forgiven so that I can forgive
 Here I stand, knowing that I’m Your desire
 Sanctified by glory and fire
