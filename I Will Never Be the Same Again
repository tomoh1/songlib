  <lyrics>[v1]
 I will never be the same again,
 I can never return, I've closed the door.
 I will walk apart, I'll run the race
 And I will never be the same again.
[c]
 Fall like fire, soak like rain,
 Flow like mighty waters, again and again.
 Sweep away the darkness, burn away the chaff,
 And let a flame burn to glorify Your name.
[v2]
 There are higher heights, there are deeper seas,
 Whatever you need to do, Lord do in me.
 The Glory of God fills my life,
 And I will never be the same again.</lyrics></song>
