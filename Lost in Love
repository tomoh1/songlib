  <lyrics>[v1]
 Manifest Your love in me
 By Your presence let me see
 Bring the love that casts out fear
 Melodies I long to hear
 Only You can dry my tears
 When I am with You
[c]
 Oh Lord, when I am with You it's easy
 I can't deny Your love
 And my heart is laid open before You
 When I am with You, I'm lost in love
[v2]
 I am lost within Your love
 When Your voice comes like a dove
 I can feel Your gentle touch
 When I am with You
 When I am with You I know
 You will stay and never go
 All Your love You freely show
 When I am with You</lyrics></song>
