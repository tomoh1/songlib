.D A D A

[V1]
.      D            A
 God, You have done great things
.      D                     A
 God, You give grace to the weak
.      D              F#m
 And bless the brokenhearted
.        E
 With a song of praise to sing

[P]
.             D                  A
 You reached down and lifted us up
.          D                   A
 You came running, looking for us
.                 D
 And now there's nothing
.    F#m                 E
 And no one beyond Your love


[C]
.           A
 You're the overflow
.            D
 You're the fountain of my heart
.          E
 Let Your mercy rain
.          D            A
 Let Your mercy rain on us||
.            A
 You're the faithful one
.          D
 When the world's falling apart
.          E
 Let Your mercy rain
.          D            A
 Let Your mercy rain on us

[B]
.     F#m       E/G#      A         D
 How deep, how wide, how long, how high
.         A             D
 Is Your love, is Your love
.     F#m       E/G#      A         D
 How deep, how wide, how long, how high
.         A             D
 Is Your love, is Your love
.     A
 Oh, God</lyrics></song>
