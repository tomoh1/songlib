[V2]
 Well Your Gospel oh Lord is the hope for our nation.  
 You are the Lord
 It’s the power of God for our salvation                             
 You are the Lord
 We ask not for riches but look to the cross                     
 You are the Lord
 And for our inheritance give us the lost 
 You are the Lord</lyrics></song>
