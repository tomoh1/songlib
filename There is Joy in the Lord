.               G               D                 Em                C
 There is joy in the Lord, there is love in His Spirit
.               G                   D                 C
 There is hope in the knowledge of Him
.                  G                   D               Em            C
 There’s a fountain that flows like a river from heaven
.    G                D               C
 Abounding in love to my soul

.        C                  G             D
 All blessing and honor are His
.         C            G              D
 All glory and power are His
.             C                   G                    C                     G
 Let all wisdom and strength be the Lord’s in this place
.              F         Am          D
 Let all glory be given to Him

[v2]
 There is joy in the Lord, there is love in His Spirit
 There is hope in the knowledge of Him
 There’s a fountain that flows every time I am near it
 My heart overflows to the Lord</lyrics></song>
