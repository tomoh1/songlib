  <lyrics>[v1]
 From the highest of heights to the depths of the sea
 Creation revealing Your majesty
 From the colors of fall to the fragrance of Spring
 Every creature unique in the song that it sings, all exclaiming

[c]
 Indescribable, uncontainable
 You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name
 You are amazing God
 All powerfull, untameable
 Awestruck, we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim
 You are amazing God

[v2]
 Who has told every lightning bolt where it should go
 Or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow
 Who imagined the sun and gives source to it's light
 Yet conceals it to bring us to the coolness of night, none can fathom

[c2]
 Indescribable, uncontainable
 You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name
 You are amazing God
 Incomparable, unchangeable
 You see the depths of my heart and You love me the same
 You are amazing God</lyrics></song>
