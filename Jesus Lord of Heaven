.C                    G
 Jesus lord of heaven
.Am              F
 I do not deserve
.      C                      G
 The grace that You have given
.         Am             F
 Or the promise of Your word
.C                      G
 Lord I stand in wonder
.        Am            F
 At the sacrifice You made
.      C                   G
 With mercy beyond measure
.    Am              F
 My debt You freely paid

[C]
.              C    G
 Your love is deeper than any ocean
. Am   F
 Higher than the heavens
. C     G                         F
 Reaches beyond the stars in the sky
.       Am        G       F
 Jesus Your love has no bounds
.       Am        G       F
 Jesus Your love has no bounds

[B]
.             C
 Your love is deep your love is wide
.             G
 Your love is great your love is high
.             Am
 Your love is all we ever need
.             F                  (G)
 Your love is all we ever need</lyrics></song>
