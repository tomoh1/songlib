.D                      Dsus  D
 Come, now is the time to worship
.A                      Em   D/F# G
 Come, now is the time to give your heart
.D                      Dsus  D
 Come, just as you are to worship
.A                     Em   D/F# G
 Come, just as you are before your God
.D
 Come

[C]
.G                           D
 One day every tongue will confess You are God
.G                      D
 One day every knee will bow
.G                             Bm
 Still the greatest treasure remains for those
.   Em                A
 Who gladly choose You now
