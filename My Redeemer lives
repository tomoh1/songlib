  <lyrics>[v1]
 For I know my Redeemer lives
 And in the end He will stand on the earth.
 For I know my Redeemer lives 
 And in the end He will reign on the earth.

[p]
 Though my flesh it be destroyed, 
 Yet with my eyes, I will see God.

[c]
 For I know that my Redeemer lives,
 And I will stand with Him on that day.
 For I know that my Redeemer lives,
 And I will stand with Him on that day.

[v2]
 How my heart it yearns within me, 
 For the day when Jesus returns.
 How my heart it yearns within me, 
 For the day when Jesus shall reign
