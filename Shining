  <lyrics>[V1]
 You guide me through the dark
 You calm my fearful heart
 I will rest in You

 You give me perfect peace
 Fulfill my deepest need
 I will rest in You

[C]
 God, shining like the sun
 Let Your kingdom come
 I want to be with You
 In Your presence
 I'm here to give You praise
 You take my breath away
 Now I'm here wth You
 In Your presence

[V2]
 Your kindness draws me in
 Now I'm with You once again
 I will rest in You
 My God who reigns on high
 To You alone I cry
 I will rest in You
 
[B]
 You are shining, You are shining
 Your light surrounds me, Your light surrounds me
 You are shining, You are shining
 Your light has found me, Your light has found me</lyrics></song>
