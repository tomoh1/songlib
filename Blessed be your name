  <lyrics>[V1]
 Blessed be Your name in the land that is plentiful
 Where Your streams of abundance flow, blessed be Your name
 Blessed be Your name, when I’m found in the desert place
 Though I walk through the wilderness, blessed be Your name||
 
 Every blessing You pour out, I’ll    turn back to praise
 When the darkness closes in Lord,   still I will say

[C]
 Blessed be the name of the Lord
 Blessed be Your name
 Blessed be the name of the Lord
 Blessed be Your glo – ri - ous name

[V2]
 Blessed be Your name when the sun's shining down on me
 When the world's all as it should be, blessed be Your name
 And blessed be Your name, on the road marked with suffering
 Though there’s pain in the offering, blessed be Your name||

 You give and take away, You give and take away
 My heart will choose to say, Lord, blessed be Your name</lyrics></song>
