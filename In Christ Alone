  <lyrics>[V1]
 In Christ alone will I glory
 Though I pride myself in battles won
 For I've been blessed beyond measure
 And by His strength I'll overcome
 Oh, I could stop and count successes like diamonds in my hands
 But those tropues could not equal the grace by which I stand

[C]
 In Christ alone I place my trust
 And find my glory in the power of the cross
 In every victory let it be said of me
 My source of strength my source of hope
 Is Christ alone 

[V2]
 In Christ alone do I glory
 For only by His grace I am redeemed
 And only His tender mercy
 Could reach beyond my weakness to my need
 And now I seek no greater honor than just to know Him more
 And to count my gains but losses to the glory of my Lord</lyrics></song>
