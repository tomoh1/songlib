  <lyrics>[v1]
 He brought me to His banqueting table
 He brought me to His banqueting table
 And His banner over me is love

[v2]
 I am my beloved's and He is mine
 Yes, I am my beloved's and He is mine
 And His banner over me is love
 Yes, His banner over me, over me, is love

[b1]
 And we can feel the love of God in this place
 We believe Your goodness, we receive Your grace
 We delight ourselves at Your table, oh God
 You do all things well, just look at our lives</lyrics></song>
