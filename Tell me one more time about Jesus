.E C#m E C#m

[C]
.E                 C#m        F#sus F#7  
 Tell me one more time about Jesus
.A          B                E
 All about forgiveness and grace
.E                 C#m        F#sus F#7  
 Tell me one more time about Jesus
.A          B            A/E   E
 All about my Savior's face

[V1]
.A                              E
 Here comes my old friend the preacher
.A                          E
 He's knocking on my front door
.A                                E
 He's out tryin' to save all the sinners
.F#7                           B
 He's been here so many times before

.A                      E
 I love the easy conversation
.A                           C#m
 Man that preacher sure can talk
.A                       E
 Brings up my need for salvation
.       F#7                              B
 Even though he knows I'm stubborn to a fault

[C]
 Tell me one more time about Jesus
 All about forgiveness and grace
 Tell me one more time about Jesus
 Lord I need just a little more faith

[V2]
.A                              E
 I walked by the church Sunday mornin'
.A                       E
 Slipped on in the back door
.A                      E
 Sure been a long time coming
.F#7                              B
 Tell me preacher what I need to know

.A                                     E
 His words were like a cool drink of water
.A                                C#m
 He said sinners come on down the aisle
.A                         E/G#
 So I went runnin' for the altar
.F#7                F#/A#                      B
 Should have seen my old friend the preacher smile

[C]
 Tell me one more time about Jesus
 All about forgiveness and grace
 Tell me one more time about Jesus
 I long to see my Savior's face
 I long to see my Savior's face
