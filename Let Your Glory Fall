  <lyrics>[v1]
 Father of Creation
 Unfold Your sovereign plan
 Raise up a chosen generation
 That will march through the land ||
 All of creation is longing
 For Your unveiling of power
 Would You release Your anointing
 Oh God let this be the hour

[c]
 Let Your glory fall in this room
 Let it go forth from here to the nations
 Let Your fragrance rest in this place
 As we gather to seek Your face

[v2]
 Ruler of the nations,
 The world has yet to see
 The full release of Your promise,
 The church in victory ||
 Turn to us Lord and touch us
 Make us strong in Your might
 Overcome our weakness
 That we could stand up and fight

[b]
 Let Your kingdom come (echo)
 Let Your will be done (echo)
 Let us see on earth (echo)
 The Glory of Your Son</lyrics></song>
