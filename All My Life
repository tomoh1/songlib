 My Freedom, my reason

 My Savior, that's what You are to me

 You free me completely
.C                Dsus
 My Savior that's what You are

[b]

 There's no other like You
 There's no one beside You
 No more than my heart can contain

[c]

 And I will love You all my life

 For You are my Reason

 The One that I live for

 For You are my Reason
