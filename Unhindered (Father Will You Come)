  <lyrics>[V1] 
 There's a love, forgetting my failures
 There's a hope, that's setting me free
 There's a light, defeating my darkness

 And there's redemption calling
 And causing all to sing

[C]
 Father will You come and open up our eyes
 Fill us with Your love, renew us with Your life
 Consume us with Your Majesty, consume us with your majesty
 
[V2]
 There's a peace, that's calming my waters
 There's a joy, that's setting me free
 He's the light defeating my darkness

 And there's redemption calling
 And causing all to sing

[B]
 Glory
 Honor
 And power
 Belong to you</lyrics>
