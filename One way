  <lyrics>[V1]
 I lay my life down at Your feet
 You're the only one I need
 I turn to You and You are always there
 In troubled times it's You I seek
 I put You first that's all I need
 I humble all I am, All to you

[C]
 One way, Jesus
 You're the only one that I could live for
 One way, Jesus
 You're the only one that I could live for

[V2]
 You are always, always there
 Every how and everywhere
 Your grace abounds so deeply within me
 You will never ever change
 Yesterday today the same
 Forever 'til forever meets no end</lyrics></song>
