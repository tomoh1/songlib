.E           Esus        Esus       E
 Sing to the King who is coming to reign
.E         Esus       Esus           E
 Glory to Jesus, the Lamb that was slain
.E          Esus        Esus          E
 Life and salvation His empire shall bring
.E           Esus        Esus       E
 And joy to the nations when Jesus is King

[C]
.E
 Come, let us sing a song
.F#m                            A
 A song declaring we belong to Jesus
.A             E    D
 He is all we need
.E
 Lift up a heart of praise
.F#m                             A
 Sing now with voices raised to Jesus
.A            E
 Sing to the King

[V2]
 For His returning we watch and we pray
 We will be ready the dawn of that day
 We'll join in singing with all the redeemed
 'Cause Satan is vanquished and my Jesus is King</lyrics>
