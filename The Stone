.    C#m            B          A
 The stone that the builder's rejected
.    C#m         B      A
 Has become the corner stone
.    F#m
 Hallelujah 

[c]
. A        E 
 Ascribed greatness
. A        E
 Ascribed greatness
. A        E
 Ascribed greatness
.       C#m  B   A
 To the Rock so high

[b]
.F#m        A
 You are a sanctuary
.   C#m         B
 A shelter, a shade
.          A
 From the heat of the day||
.F#m       A 
 You are a hiding place
.  C#m       B
 A tower, a refuge
.          A
 From the storm and the rain
.    A         B 
 My Rock and foundation
.C#m       B         A 
 You have become my salvation
