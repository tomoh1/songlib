  <lyrics>[V]
 You are the source of life,
 I can't be left behind,
 No one else will do,
 I will take hold of you,

[C]
 I need you Jesus,
 To come to my rescue,
 Where else can i go?
 There's no other name
 By which I am saved,
 Capture me with grace,
 I will follow you.

[B]
 This world has nothing for me,
 I will follow you
 This world has nothing for me,
 I will follow you,
 This world has nothing for me,
 I'm gonna follow you,
 This world has nothing for me

[C2]
 I need you Jesus
 To come to my rescue
 Where else can I go?
 There's no other name
 Which I am saved,
 Capture me with grace,
 Lord, come and capture me with grace.
 Capture me with grace,
 I will follow you,
 I will follow you. </lyrics></song>
