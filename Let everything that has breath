.E                         E/D#
 Praise You in the morning
.                          C#m7
 Praise You in the evening
.                                        A  B   E
 Praise You when I'm young and when I'm old

 Praise You when I'm laughing
.                             C#m7
 Praise You when I'm grieving
.                                 A  B
 Praise You every season of the soul

[P]
.  F#m7               B
 If we could see how much You're worth
.      F#m7                    B
 Your power, Your might, Your endless love
.      F#m7            B               A       B
 Then surely we would never cease to praise

[V2]
 Praise You in the heavens
 Joining with the angels
 Praising You forever and a day
 Praise You on the earth now
 Joining with creation
 Calling all the nations to Your praise</lyrics></song>
