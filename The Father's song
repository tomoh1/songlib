.E                Emaj7/D#
 I have heard so many songs
.E7              A/C#
 Listened to a thousand tongues
.     F#m               B                C#m7-B
 But there is one that sounds above them all
.E                       Emaj7/D#
 The Father's song, the Father's love
.E7               A/C#
 You sung it over me and for
.  F#m            B            E
 Eternity, it's written on my heart

[C]
.                  A/C#  B/D#
 Heaven's perfect melody
.               E/G#    A
 The creator's symphony
.                F#m     B
 You are singing over me
.              C#m-B
 The Father's song
.                  A/C#   B/D#
 Heaven's perfect mystery
.                      E/G#       A
 The King of Love has sent for me
.                       F#m     B
 And now you're singing over me
.              E
