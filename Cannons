  <lyrics>[V1]
 It's falling from the clouds
 A strange and lovely sound
 I hear it in the thunder and the rain
[V2]
 It's ringing in the skies
 Like cannons in the night
 The music of the universe plays
[C]
 Singing you are holy great and mighty
 The moon and the stars declare who you are
 I'm so unworthy but still you love me
 Forever my heart will sing of how great you are
[V3]
 Beautiful and free
 The song of galaxies
 Reaching far beyond the milky way
[V4]
 Let's join in with the sound
 Come on let's sing it out
 As the music of the universe plays
[B]
 All glory honor power is yours amen
 All glory honor power is yours amen
 All glory honor power is yours forever amen</lyrics></song>
