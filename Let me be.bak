.D                            D/G
 Lord You are the maker of my heart
.D                          D/G
 Framer and reshaper of my soul
.Em         Asus
 Master and creator
.G          D/F#
 Healer and sustainer
.Em                          D/G
 I will put my trust in You alone||

.D                          D/G
 Teach me to be faithful to confess
.D                             D/G
 In this way my spirit will be blessed
.Em                Asus
 Though my sins are daily
.G                 D/F#
 You have loved me greatly
.Em                                D/G
 Removing them as far as east from west

[c]
.          D
 Let me be open
.          D/G
 Let me be humble
.                Em                        G
 Let me find the joy of my salvation in Your cross ||
.          D                 D/G
 Let me be broken Whenever I stumble
.        Em                A            D
 Let me remember the great mercy of my God

[v2]
 Give me the full measure of your grace
 As it is reflected in the Word
 Faith and reassurance
 Mercy and endurance
 Carry these to those who haven’t heard

[b]
.            G                      D
 All I have needed is laid at your table
.           G                        A
 All my achievements, I lay at your feet
.D/F#           G                      D
 Alive in your spirit, I’m willing and able
.                Em      A Asus A
 You make my joy complete</lyrics>
