.C#m       A         E         B
 Amazing grace how sweet the sound
.      C#m      A          E B
 That saved a wretch like me
.   C#m      A        E        B
 I once was lost but now I'm found
.      C#m      A     E B
 Was blind but now I see

[C]
.C#m   A                E          B
 Hallelujah grace like rain falls down on me
.C#m   A             E                 B
 Hallelujah all my stains are washed away are washed away

[V2]
 'Twas Grace that taught my heart to fear
 And Grace my fears relieved
 How precious did that Grace appear
 The hour I first believed

[Interlude]

[V3]
 When we've been there ten thousand years
 Bright shining as the sun
 We've no less days to sing Your praise
 Than when we'd first begun</lyrics></song>
