.G                       D
 Better than the riches of this world
.Em7                      C2
 Better than the sound of my friends’ voices
.G                       D
 Better than the biggest dreams of my heart
.    Em7              C2
 And that’s just the start

[v2]
 Better than getting what I say I need
 Better than living the life that I want to
 Better than the love anyone could give
 Your love is

[b]
.     G      Am           G/B
 You hold me now in Your arms
.    C2            D
 And never let me go

[c1]
.G                     D
 You oh Lord make the sun shine
.        Em7                C2
 And the moon light in the night sky
.    G                   D
 You give me breath and all Your love
.   Em7             C2
 I give my heart to You because

[c2]

 I can’t stop falling in love with You

 I’ll never stop falling in love with You
.   D         Em7         C		
 I can’t stop falling in love with You
.      D          Em7        C	    G
 I’ll never stop falling in love with You</lyrics></song>
