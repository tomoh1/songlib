 Strip away the evidence of me

 'Til Your glory is all there is to see
.                              E    C#m B
 Lead me Lord unto the altar again

 Hide me in the shadow of your wing
.C#m                           B

 Lead me to the altar of sacrifice
.                                   A
 Where I place my heart my will my life

 Everything before You I lay down
.                            F#m
 All of my trophies and my crowns

[V2]
 Purify my heart consume my will
 Burn in me a passion deeper still
 Lead me Lord unto the altar again
  
 All of me surrender to Your ways
 All to You and only for Your name
 Lead me Lord unto the altar again

[T]
 Lead me there, lead me there, with my soul laid bare
 Lead me there, lead me there
 Lead me on, lead me on, lead me on to the altar
 Lead me on, lead me on to the altar again</lyrics></song>
