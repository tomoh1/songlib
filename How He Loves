  <lyrics>[V]
 He is jealous for me
 Loves like a hurricane
 I am a tree bending beneath
 The weight of His wind and mercy
[V2]
 When all of a sudden
 I am unaware of these afflictions
 Eclipsed by glory
 And I realize just how beautiful You are
 And how great Your affections are for me
[P]
 Oh how He loves us so
 Oh how He loves us
 How He loves us so
[C]
 Yeah He loves us
 Oh how He loves us
 Oh how He loves us
 Oh how He loves
[V3]
 We are His portion
 And He is our prize
 Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes
 If grace is an ocean we're all sinking
[V4]
 So heaven meets earth like an unforeseen kiss
 And my heart turns violently inside of my chest
 I don't have the time to maintain these regrets
 When I think about the way</lyrics></song>
