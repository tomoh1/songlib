.D            Asus               Em
 Light of the world You stepped down into darkness
.D         Asus         G2
 Opened my eyes, let me see
.D           Asus       Em
 Beauty that made this heart adore You
.D         Asus            G2
 Hope of a life spent with You

[C]
.              D                   A/C#
 Here I am to worship here I am to bow down
.             D/F#                G
 Here I am to say that You're my God
.                  D                A/C#
 You're altogether lovely altogether worthy
.           D/F#          G
 Altogether wonderful to me

[V2]
 King of all days oh so highly exalted
 Glorious in heaven above 
 Humbly You came to the earth You created
 All for loveâ€™s sake became poor

[B]
.    A/C#   D/F#      G
 I'll never know how much it cost
.    A/C#   D/F# G
 To see my sin upon that cross</lyrics></song>
