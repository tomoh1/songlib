.    F       C       F       G
 In Christ alone my hope is found
.          F          G           C
 He is my light, my strength, my song
.      F      C          F      G
 This cornerstone, this solid ground
.                  F         G           C
 Firm through the fiercest drought and storm

.      C/E        F          Am        G
 What heights of love, what depths of peace
.                 F              Am      G
 When fears are stilled, when strivings cease
.    F     C       F     G
 My comforter, my all in all
.             F         G       C
 Here in the love of Christ I stand


[V2]
 In Christ alone, Who took on flesh
 Fullness of God in helpless babe
 This gift of love and righteousness
 Scorned by the ones He came to save

 Till on that cross as Jesus died
 The wrath of God was satisfied
 For every sin on Him was laid
 Here in the death of Christ I live
---
[V3]
 There in the ground His body lay
 Light of the world by darkness slain
 Then bursting forth in glorious day
 Up from the grave He rose again

 And as He stands in victory
 Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
 For I am His and He is mine
 Bought with the precious blood of Christ


[V4]
 No guilt in life, no fear in death
 This is the power of Christ in me
 From life's first cry to final breath
 Jesus commands my destiny

 No power of hell, no scheme of man
 Can ever pluck me from His hand
 Till He returns or calls me home
 Here in the power of Christ I'll stand</lyrics>
