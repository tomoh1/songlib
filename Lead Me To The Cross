  <lyrics>[v1]
 Savior I come
 Quiet my soul, remember
 Redemption's hill
 Where Your blood was spilled
 For my ransom

[p]
 Everything I once held dear
 I count it all as loss

[c]
 Lead me to the cross
 Where Your love poured out
 Bring me to my knees
 Lord I lay me down ||
 Rid me of myself 
 I belong to You
 Lead me, lead me to the cross

[v2]
 You were as I, tempted and tried
 Human, the word became flesh
 Bore my sin and death
 Now you're risen

[b]
 To your heart
 To your heart
 Lead me to your heart
 Lead me to your heart</lyrics>
