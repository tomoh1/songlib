  <lyrics>[v1]
 God of justice savior to all
 Came to rescue the weak and the poor
 Chose to serve and not be served
[p]
 Jesus, you have called us
 Freely we've received
 Now freely we will give
[c]
 We must go live to feed the hungry
 Stand beside the broken we must go
 Stepping forward keep us from just singing
 Move us into action we must go
[v2]
 To act justly everyday
 Loving mercy in every way
 Walking humbly before you God
[p2]
 You have shown us what you require
 Freely we've received
 Now freely we will give
[b]
 Fill us up and send us out
 Fill us up and send us out
 Fill us up and send us out Lord</lyrics></song>
