;Soft
. D A/C#     Bm  A
 Beauty for ashes
.  G            D/F#
 A garment of praise
. Em7    A/D  D
 For my heaviness
. D A/C#     Bm  A
 Beauty for ashes
.  G        D/F#     Em7
 Take this heart of stone
.     A/D
 And make it
;Swell in to first Yours, build to chorus
. Bm  C   Bm  A
 Yours...Yours

[C]
;Full
.    D                    Bm
 I delight myself in the richest of fare
.        C/G
 Trading all that I've had
.     Em7         A
 For all that is better
.   D                        Bm
 A garment of praise for my heaviness
.    C/G               Em7
 You are the greatest taste
;Softer
.             A         D
 You're the richest of fare</lyrics></song>
