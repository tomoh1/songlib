  <lyrics>[V1]
. G      G7        C         G          Em      A           D  D7
 Amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me;
.  G        G7       C       G          Em        D     C   G
 I once was lost but now I'm found, was blind but now I see.

[V2]
.     G          G7        C        G         Em       A       D      D7
 Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears relieved;
.    G        G7       C       G        Em     D       C      G
 How precious did that grace appear the hour I first believed!

[V3]
.        G    G7       C          G        Em     A     D    D7
 Through many dangers, toils, and snares I have already come;
.     G          G7         C         G       Em         D       C    G
 'Tis grace that brought me safe thus far and grace will lead me home.

[V4]
.     G          G7        C        G            Em      A      D   D7
 When we've been there ten thousand years bright shining as the sun;
.      G       G7      C          G           Em        D       C   G
 We've no less days to sing God's praise than when we'd first begun!</lyrics>
