.D       A/C#        Bm       Bm/A
 As the deer panteth for the water
.       G           A       D
 So my soul longeth after Thee
.    A/C#          Bm         Bm/A
 You alone are my heart’s desire
.       G            A   D   
 And I long to worship Thee

[C]
.Bm   Bm/A            G         D
 You alone are my strength my shield
.    G      Bm         Em     F#
 To You alone may my spirit yield
. D    A/C#        Bm        Bm/A
 You alone are my heart’s desire
.       G       A        D
 And I long to worship Thee

[V2]
 I want You more than gold or silver
 Only You can satisfy
 You alone are the real joy giver
 And the apple of my eye

[V3]
 You’re my friend and You are my brother
 Even though You are a King
 I love You more than any other
 So much more than anything</lyrics></song>
