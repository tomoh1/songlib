.G      D/F#         Em                C2
 Father, I can't explain this kind of love
.               D
 This kind of grace
.    G  D/F#                Em  
 I know I still break Your heart
.             C              D 
 And yet You run to welcome me

[C]
.            G        C        D
 This is my song of praise to You
.             G      C             D  
 For who You are and all that You do
.          Em        C      D
 From the moment my life began
.                     C
 You have been faithful

[V2]
 Father, I love the way You hold me close
 And say my name
 I know when my life is through
 My heart will find its hope in You
